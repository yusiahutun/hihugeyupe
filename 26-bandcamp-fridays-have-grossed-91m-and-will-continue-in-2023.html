On all Bandcamp Fridays, the company waives its commissions and fees.
Since launching at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020, fans have spent more than $91 million dollars during the 26 Bandcamp Fridays that followed. “Participation has remained consistently high,” writes Bandcamp, “with each Bandcamp Friday generating millions of dollars of extra income for artists and labels."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The gaming giant and creator of Fortnite said then that it would make Bandcamp part of a plan “to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem for content, technology, games, art, music, and more.”</p><p>The sale worried many in the independent music community who rely on Bandcamp. But so far, there have been no public changes at Bandcamp, and Epic has not built out the promised creator marketplace ecosystem.</p><p>A major factor in the delay is likely Epic and Bandcamp’s ongoing battle with Apple and Google over app store restrictions and 30% fees. Just the week, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a></strong>&nbsp;that he was willing to take that fight all the way to the Supreme Court.</p><p>All that could change in 2023.</p><p><strong>Bruce Houghton</strong>&nbsp;is the Founder and Editor of&nbsp;<a href=#>Hypebot</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>MusicThinkTank</a>, a Senior Advisor at&nbsp;<a href=#>Bandsintown</a>, President of the<a href=#>&nbsp;Skyline Artists Agency</a>, and a professor for the&nbsp;<a href=#>Berklee College Of Music</a>.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ39wfZFoaG9nYmt6o63NnZqapaBis7O1w5qwrGWYlsOmecarpqyrlZl6en3MZpinnF2stq24jJymp6yZo8KmecinZGtoYmh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
