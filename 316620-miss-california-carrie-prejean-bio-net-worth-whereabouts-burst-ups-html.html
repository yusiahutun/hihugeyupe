In an interview with Donald Trump following Larry vs Prejean interviews, Trump expressed her disappointment with the model.</p><p class=align-left>Prejean had attended the interview with Larry King to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">promote her new book</a> but seemed to make exceptions whenever Larry posed questions regarding her relationship with Miss USA Pageant. Larry also brought up questions regarding Prejean and the lawsuit by Miss Universe pageant owned by Trump. She was, however, uncomfortable and even wanted to step out of the interview.</p><h3>Carrie Prejean and Trump</h3><p class=align-left>Carrie was one of the best contestants in the Miss Universe Pageant. On one occasion, Trump was spotted having a one-on-one conversation with the then Miss California. However, following the fall out with her bosses, Trump was seen coming out firmly against Prejean’s conduct.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6bea3641a8554573.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Delta Burke: Gerald McRaney relationship, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Donald Trump, the owner of Miss USA Pageant, decided to fire Carrie barely a month after he decided to give the model a second chance to reclaim her title as the reigning Miss California. The decision to fire the top model and first runners up in the Miss USA pageant was solely based on contract violations as opposed to rumours that it was her anti-gay-marriage utterances.</p><p class=align-left>The agency stated that it was her unwillingness to act in line with the terms of her contract like making an appearance in the Miss California USA organization. As a result, Lewis responded to questions by CNN’s Larry King that Carrie’s dismissal was contributed by an array of issues about her contract which are in several counts rather than one-time misconduct.</p><h3>Miss California 2009</h3><p class=align-left>Heading to being the overall winner of Miss California Pageant, Prejean had taken part in the competition over the previous years. In 2007, she competed for the coveted award and later in 2008 made it to the USA Beauty Pageant emerging the first runners-up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7c8f0f39d42f9399.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melissa Womer: children, Jim Carrey, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2009, she returned to the completion and scooped the Miss California title taking over from Raquel Beezley, the former Miss California representative for the Trump-owned agency. She further competed in the nationally televised and largely followed Miss USA Pageant 2009 that took place in Las Vegas, Nevada. Despite being the first runners-up, her last answer on the subject of gay marriage became a subject of a much-heated debate.</p><h3>Carrie Prejean today</h3><p class=align-left>After a long season of controversy, it is commendable how Carrie managed to stand on her feet once again and ventured into writing. In November 2009, she released her first book titled Still Standing: The Untold Story of My Fight Against Gossip, Hate, and Political Attacks that was published by a conservative publisher, Regnery Publishing.</p><p class=align-left>In the book, Prejean speaks about attacks targeted to her with the hope of destroying her career and demean her conservative values. She called Larry King inappropriate for asking questions on why she opted to settle the lawsuit that was brought against her by Miss California USA Pageant.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6e4eab0d93bac84.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shay Mitchell net worth, daughter, parents, boyfriend, is she Indian?</span></p></a><h3>Carrie Prejean burst ups</h3><p class=align-left>Carrie rose to fame when she won the Miss California pageant in 2009 and the first runners-up in the Miss USA pageant 2009. Afterward, she was the topic of hot debate both politically and socially.

Carrie's religious beliefs and standings go against gay marriage, and she does not support it. She was later dethroned by the owner of the pageant, Trump because she was uncooperative.</p><p class=align-left>She sued the pageant for what she termed as discrimination because of her religious standings and beliefs and wanted compensation. In a turn of event, the pageant countersued the model claiming she had reneged on the terms of her contract. He pageant required that she repays the money she used for her breast implants and give the organization all the proceeds she received from her book.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/80c18f37607fce1f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jamie Clayton bio: partner, transgender, family, movies and tv shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After the dust settles, it was clear that Carrie Prejean was adversely affected by the controversies and issues regarding her career and standpoints on gay marriages.
