He attended a local high school but never went to college. Fritz loved to collect rocks and old beer cans as a young boy and later became interested in vintage cars and toys. The details of his background and upbringing have not been disclosed. His siblings and parents are also unknown.</p><p class=align-left>The TV personality is also a tattoo fanatic. He has multiple <a href=#>tattoos</a> on his arms, with some being done by James Hawk of ''Hawk's Tattoos''. The show host had inked his left arm but now has full sleeve designs on both his arms after paying a visit to Hawk.</p><p class=align-left>The American picker started his career by working as a safety and fire inspector for about 25 years. While working here, he collected antiques but eventually decided to quit his job to pursue his heart's desire. In 2010, his career breakthrough came when he joined the reality series <i>American Pickers.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e6dd275c55bf3df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bob Barker from The Price Is Right: net worth, wife, children, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The show, which has featured about 22 seasons, has allowed Frank to work with accomplished stars like <a href=#>Mike Wolfe</a> and Danielle Colby, a fellow collector whose role was to direct Fritz and Mike to their various finds.</p><p class=align-left>The series also airs in the UK, Spain, Romania, and Israel. Today, Frank has risen in popularity and has earned himself a massive fan base due to his role on the show.</p><h2>What happened to Frank on American Pickers?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44a1c83012c4c607.jpg><p class=align-left>Fritz was part of American Pickers since its debut. Together with his colleague, Mike Wolfe, he has travelled across America searching for treasure in dumpsites, barns, and even in unlikely places like walls. They grew famous for finding unique collections then digging to find out their history. Wolfe is married to <a href=#>Jodi Faeth</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The show's 22nd season premiered in January 2021, but Frank was conspicuously missing. He was also absent from the mid-season return in early June. His absence has stirred rumours from viewers of the 10-year show, with some claiming that Frank and Mike Wolfe had split.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a134e33615cbe6f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dolvett Quince biography: wife, children, family, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Did Frank from American Pickers die? The star's disappearance from the show brought about rumours that he was dead. In the last season, his sudden weight loss also brought about these claims, not to mention the health issues that he has been facing. However, Frank is alive and kicking.</p><p class=align-left>So, who passed away on American Pickers? Frank Fritz had joined hands with Mike Wolfe to dedicate the American Pickers show to their colleague, Staunton's Al Morkunas, in August 2017. For this reason, the dedication was in memory of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Morkunas</a> and not Frank Fritz.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, all the stories concerning American Pickers Frank Fritz death are untrue. However, there are a couple of reasons why the reality star may have left the show.</p><h3>Frank Fritz's back surgery</h3><p class=align-left>The 56-year-old recently underwent back surgery, as revealed by his co-host, Mike Wolfe. It has not been made clear what precisely the surgery was for. Most back or spine surgeries are followed by a lengthy recovery process and physical therapy one to three months post-surgery.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f32863c147a96f88.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melanie Bright: 5 interesting facts about Lynette Nusbacher's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fritz has also been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">battling Crohn's disease</a>, a type of inflammatory bowel disease which causes inflammation of the digestive tract. This condition can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. However, Frank reported that he worked on his weight to manage the abdominal pains brought about by his illness.</p><p class=align-left>With the <a href=#>COVID-19</a> pandemic, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources</a> have claimed that Frank has deliberately kept off <i>American Pickers </i>due to his pre-existing condition. As a result, the collector has been isolating in his Iowa home.</p><h3>House sale</h3><p class=align-left>After leaving the show, the collector sold his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Iowa mansion</a>, worth $358,000, in January 2021. Frank had bought the property in 2018 alongside his then-fiancee, Diann Bankson. The luxurious house boasted three bedrooms and three bathrooms and sits on 2,780 square feet.</p><p class=align-left>Other features of the Iowa property include hardwood floors and carpeting in the bedrooms. The kitchen contains black and white granite countertops and white cabinets with a grey tile backsplash. The master bedroom also has a walk-in closet.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/70fdda3d03ca6774.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Fantasia's husband?

According to other reports, Diann had caught her lover in bed with another woman in 2018. The lovebirds sorted out their differences and reconciled, but only for a short while.</p><p class=align-left>After some time, an incident took place in their home, whereby Frank and a friend set off fireworks. They attempted to light up the fireworks using a closed cylinder vintage ashtray. However, the firework did not light, and the two reportedly left it in the covered intake ashtray instead of properly disposing of the firework.</p><p class=align-left>Diann used the ashtray while smoking a cigarette and suffered burns on her arms, eyelashes and eyebrows. She claimed that the actor refused to take her to hospital, although she received treatment the following day and was diagnosed with third-degree burns.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bcb3d70c8fa09d21.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All American's Daniel Ezra: height, partner, sexuality, parents</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Frank's ex dropped the lawsuit in March 2020. It is not clear whether the breakup contributed to his exit from the show.</p><p class=align-left>The picker had a previous incident in 2017 where he was arrested for swerving on the road and driving in the wrong direction. He took a sobriety test and was found to be intoxicated with Xanax and alcohol. Frank pleaded guilty to the charges.</p><p class=align-left>The 56-year-old was ordered to pay $625 plus legal fees, attend a rehabilitation program, and serve one year of unsupervised probation. At that time, Fritz had also taken a break from the TV series.</p><h3>Store</h3><p class=align-left>Shortly after he started appearing on the History Channel's series, Frank went into the antique <a href=#>business</a> alongside his childhood friend and co-host, Mike Wolfe. They founded the “Antique Archeology” shop in Le Claire, Iowa.</p><p class=align-left>The business later expanded, and they opened a second store in Nashville. Once the pair travel across the country collecting unique stuff and junk, they later clean everything up and sell it in their stores.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/51b104711cbee199.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ivy Calvin from "Storage Wars": net worth, Grandma's Attic, married, eyes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Their enterprise became famous because of their TV show attracting numerous visitors. The business partners also founded ‘'<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kid Pickers</a>: How to Turn Junk Into Treasure'’, a website where kids can discuss the items they found. They also co-founded a restoration company where antiques are refurbished.</p><p class=align-left>The stores are still operational, and it is not clear whether the picker left the show to focus on running his business. Given his passion for collecting treasure, ancient bicycles and motorcycles, Fritz may still collect treasure but not for TV. Whatever the case, he is sure to continue building his impressive net worth, which is estimated at $4 million.</p><h2>Is Frank Fritz coming back to American Pickers?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e52fa9e149514f7.jpg><p class=align-left>It is unlikely that Fritz has left the show for good. The History Channel network hinted that he would return soon after his recovery process. Fans continued to wait for his anticipated return. Concerning his future, Frank has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that after the show is over, he will get rid of his stuff and retreat to an everyday, quiet life in Iowa.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/523f8221b1f02073.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cody Christian bio: Height, net worth, sexuality, spouse, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a>, on July 21, 2021, Frank's co-star Mike confirmed Frank would not be returning to the show after their feud.</p><p class=align-left>American Pickers' Frank Fritz is still a vibrant actor, having built himself an empire in the television industry.

He is the creator of the show and has also appeared in <i>NCIS</i>. Frank Frtiz is worth $4 million and takes home $500,000 from the reality series.

Her financial worth is approximately $1.5 million.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0283261fc7900076.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tim Rozon: spouse, sexuality, height, Schitt's Creek, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fk2pncmldlrqmvsicmKdloJ6wrLHRrGSfqpGjuG6y0aKrs2WUmq61tIyrrKanpafAbrjArZysrF2qvaWt056qZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
