But, unfortunately, Tucker's birth mother passed away in October 2011 at the age of 66.</p><p class=align-left>Tucker's father is Richard Warner Carlson, famously known as Dick Carlson. He is a former journalist who worked as the director for Voice of America.

However, because the family was patriarchal, the male side of the family reportedly controlled the money and even had access to a trust fund dedicated to Patricia, who had only received allowances from the fund.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/72a59f054970f7a8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Aman Tyler Perry: What you should know about Tyler Perry's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unknown to many, the Patrica fund had been opened by her father when she got married to her first husband.
