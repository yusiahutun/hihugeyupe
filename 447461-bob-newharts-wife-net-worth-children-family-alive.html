Therefore, this means that Bob Newhart is of mixed ethnicity.</p><p class=align-left>When Bob was young, he attended Roman Catholic schools in the Chicago region. The schools include St. Catherine of Siena Grammar School in Oak Park and St. Ignatius College Prep (high school).</p><p class=align-left>He graduated from high school in 1947 and <a href=#>went to college</a> at Loyola University of Chicago.

After abandoning his law degree and leaving school in 1956, Bob started working a string of jobs. He eventually <a href=#>got a job</a> as a bookkeeper and took acting roles in a local theatrical stock company on the side.</p><p class=align-left>At the time, he used to engage in humorous telephone conversations with his friend, whereby he improvised characters. Newhart and his friend proceeded to record these funny conversations and tried to sell them to radio stations.</p><p class=align-left>The business endeavour was not as successful as Newhart and his friend expected, but it was fruitful as he captured the attention of a local disc jockey. The disc jockey gave Rob Newhart a chance to perform comedic monologues on the radio.
