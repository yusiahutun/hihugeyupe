Do something for yourself, keep doing it, be selfish with it, do not seek external validation for it, and above all else, enjoy it. Do something for others irrespective of your feelings to help and with that seek feedback. Most importantly, make time for family, friends, and those you judge as valuable, enjoy them, experience them fully, because the only thing that matters, in the end, are your relationships with people. Be blessed," reads one of the posts by the passionate doctor.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8a14875c06d9444c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ best Lucky Dube quotes about life, love, success, and politics</span></p></a><h2>Stylish gentleman</h2><p class=align-left>Diana Vreeland says; "Fashion is part of the daily air and it changes all the time, with all the events.
