Corruption</h3><p class=align-left>The meeting between Mossi, Bembe, and Harvester shows how corrupt the leaders of Maracas were. Bembe has committed a lot of atrocities, such as the violations of human rights and land grabbing. Conversely, Mossi is guilty of municipal capture; he awards tenders to friends and <a href=#>family</a>.</p><h3 id=506306-2-misuse-of-power class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Misuse of power</h3><p class=align-left>In the play, it's evident that people in power or leadership positions use their offices to get what they want and to influence certain decisions. Harvester, the municipality CEO, abuses public office by drafting a letter to the government to ban the Samaritan application.</p><p class=align-left>Jaden, the judge, and Harvester agree to hold a meeting for the warring parties to call a truce. During the meeting, they agree that Jaden should file cases and make them disappear by adjourning them.

Fear and courage</h3><p class=align-left>There's a sense of fear and courage throughout the play, as revealed by the actions and conversations of some of the characters. Alvita, Montano, and Nicole have the courage to develop and launch an app that exposes the dirt of their <a href=#>most powerful leaders</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Montano and Alvita are fearful about the outcome of the Samaritan app on Nicole after she received a day threat from Mayor Mossi. However, Nicole confirms that everything will be alright and that they must be hopeful that the application uncovers the entire scandals in the municipality.</p><p class=align-left>Mayor Mossi and other leaders fear for their fates when the Samaritan app takes a turn for the worse, and news about the rot in the municipality dominates headlines in the daily newspapers.</p><h3 id=506306-4-false-accusations class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. False accusations</h3><p class=align-left>In the play, Bembe and Narine approach Nicole to check her office. Nicole is then arrested for failing to stop the Samaritan app and being stubborn. They also frame her for stealing the school generator they had sent thugs to steal. But Nicole is later released by Jayden, the judge, who found her innocent after a protest by those who attended the hearing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4e9a32ba9a73e301.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Evelyn Cheluget Appointed Immigration Director-General as Muteshi Proceeds on Terminal Leave</span></p></a><h3 id=506306-5-arguments-and-disagreements class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Arguments and disagreements</h3><p class=align-left>The theme of arguments and disagreement is evident in The Samaritan set book because most of the play's characters have conflicts. Mossi, the mayor, disagrees with Nicole over the Samaritan mobile app. He denies launching it on counts of possible misinformation and asks Nicole to stop it.</p><p class=align-left>Those in leadership at the municipality disagree with Basdeo, the opposition leader, and insist he is behind the leaked documents on the app. They plan to meet with the councilors to push for a vote of no confidence in Basdeo.</p><h2 id=506306-frequently-asked-questions class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Frequently asked questions</h2><li>Who is the author of <i>The Samaritan</i> setbook?
