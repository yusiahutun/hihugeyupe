Shockingly the person who killed her daughter wasn't a known criminal or serial killer.

After convincing their babysitter to take a break, he sexually assaulted and killed his baby sister, four-year-old Ella. Paris then called 911 to report the murder.</p><p class=align-left>The 13-year-old teenager, who lived with his mom and young sister, became so hated by US citizens and the media that he got sentenced as a grown-up despite being a minor.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/234ca8d1eda7df98.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maranda High School: Grieving Mum Claims Form Three Son Died after School Delayed to Take Him to Hospital</span></p></a><h3>Why did Paris Bennett murder his baby sister?</h3><p class=align-left>Paris, a convicted murderer with a genius IQ of 141, purported that <a href=#>he murdered</a> the four-year-old Ela to get vengeance on his mom, Charity Lee.</p><p class=align-left>Before getting her two kids, Charity Bennett had suffered from <a href=#>drug addiction</a>. But she relapsed when Ella was two and Paris was nine. This made his son, Paris Bennett, angry, and he decided to take out the anger on his mom in the most terrible way imaginable.</p><p class=align-left>Immediately after, the convicted murderer claimed he experienced hallucinations, but according to the medical report, he was in his right mind. Paris was later diagnosed as a psychopath and incarcerated for 40 years.</p><p class=align-left>But despite the devastating and shocking event, Charity Bennett says that she has forgiven Paris and still loves him. She occasionally visits Paris Bennett in prison because his incarceration offers her peace.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/790a184bd07fc25e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where is Beth Thomas brother now?
