Originally a time tracker, it increases transparency in remote work management so that managers are always aware of the work process despite the distance.</p><p>To make remote work management efficient, WebWork tracks time, app and website usage, attendance, productivity and activity levels. Then all of this information is available to the manager to ensure all team members are working conscientiously.</p><p>Now WebWork also has a task management system, chatting and video call features, and HR tools.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>So how does WebWork Improve Remote Work Management?</h2><p>Teams that work remotely, use WebWork to manage the whole work process.</p><p>Here’s how and why:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Time Tracking</h3><p>By tracking the time spent on work, WebWork enables teams to be more mindful of their time management. Especially when working remotely, it is not possible to know how involved employees are or if they work the required amount of hours or not. That’s when time tracking is essential to ensure no hour is wasted for irrelevant reasons.</p><p>Plus it makes employees mindful of their time and helps them to manage it better.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Task Management</h3><p>Remote work calls for using multiple digital tools to keep the team connected, manage projects remotely, hold meetings, and more. To reduce the confusion of using many apps, WebWork functions as all of these. Teams can manage their tasks and projects on WebWork while tracking time. They can assign tasks, write comments, attach files, and more.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Attendance Monitoring</h3><p>WebWork tracks the attendance of employees based on when they start and finish the tracker. This way the manager is always aware when an employee starts work late or finishes early. Moreover, to notify the manager about the reason for being late or finishing early, WebWork opens a pop-up asking for the reason. Then there is no need to contact the manager separately to tell them the reason. They can see the answers in bulk in the attendance reports.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. App and Website Usage Monitoring</h3><p>To make remote work management even simpler, WebWork tracks the usage of apps and websites as well. It then provides the data to the manager. When used in the right way, it helps ensure that employees are not spending work time on distracting platforms. After all, when working remotely, there is no other way to be sure that working time is spent efficiently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WebWork-Is-Transforming-Remote-Work-Management-2_11zon-1024x537.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Activity Level Tracking</h3><p>When working remotely, it is essential to know how much employees are involved in work. Sometimes, just being online is not an indicator of being busy with work. That’s where the activity feature of WebWork comes to help. It tracks the number of mouse clicks and keystrokes and creates reports based on them. Note that the lack of mouse clicks and keystrokes is not always a sign of poor activity, so take all factors into consideration.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Productivity Level Tracking</h3><p>While the best way to measure productivity is through results, during remote work applying an extra measure wouldn’t hurt. WebWork estimates how productive employees are based on the amount of time they spend on work and non-productive platforms. In case of poor results of an employee, the productivity report is the next stop to view their performance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Communication Tools</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, WebWork functions as not only a time tracker, but as a communication tool. Remote teams can manage their tasks, chat about them and hold video meetings right inside WebWork.</p><p>As a result, WebWork simplifies the process of remote work management by making the work process transparent and easy to manage and by combining the most common remote tools into one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>WebWork Is Simplifying Freelancing and Outsourcing Too!</h2><p>Freelancers and teams that do outsourcing use WebWork for tracking time and managing projects. As freelancers mostly work with an hourly-based contract, they need to track time to be paid accurately. That’s what freelancers use WebWork for, as it has the feature of billable hours.</p><p>WebWork can also be used not only for freelancing but also for outsourcing purposes. Companies that hire <a href=#>outsourcing</a> services can use WebWork as a task manager. Especially if they are outsourcing a team and a service, they can centralize the whole team in one place. On WebWork they can assign and manage tasks, communicate and track time if necessary.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Summing Up</h2><p>As an aspiring all-in-one tool, WebWork is helping remote teams simplify work management and make sure the workflow does not suffer because of distance.</p><p>Get WebWork <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> and stay tuned for more upcoming features.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FAQ</h2><li><strong>Does WebWork Time Tracker take screenshots of the screen?</strong> Yes, WebWork has the feature of screenshots that can be turned on and off. It can also blur the screenshots if necessary.</li><li><strong>Does WebWork have a payroll system to pay remote employees?</strong> Very soon WebWork will have a payroll integration and users will be able to pay and be paid directly on WebWork.</li><li><strong>How much does WebWork cost?</strong> WebWork costs $4.99 per user/month and has a 14-day free trial.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZIRuw8CyqmavlZfEsL7KZqCmqKKkw6Z50Z6kqKyVYsSwvspmpJqmkZyyrrHNrQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
