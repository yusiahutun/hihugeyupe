Mine certainly wasn't. After four years of an on-and-off-again <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>toxic relationship</a>, I was left feeling pretty lost once it officially ended. As someone who was diagnosed with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) at a young age, dwelling in the past is kind of my thing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I thought I'd never come out of that dark place, but after a couple of years, things got better. I graduated college, moved to a major city (twice), and got a job at a fashion magazine. I was thriving and loving my single life. Sure, my ex crossed my mind every now and again, but I felt independent and happy — that is, until I found out he was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"winning" the breakup</a> a.k.a. dating someone else (a friend of mine, no less). This re-triggered the extreme anxiety I felt when things first ended. It actually felt like I was living through the breakup all over again. Clearly, I had heaps of unresolved emotions around our split that I'd suppressed for years, and they all came bubbling to the surface. On top of it all, I was angry and frustrated that he still had an effect on me. Quite honestly, I felt pathetic. I was in emotional hell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So when I heard that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practices, like acupuncture and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ear seeding,</a> could work wonders for mental health, I figured I'd give it a go — I'd already tried pretty much everything else. As a total acupuncture virgin though, I was definitely skeptical. How did it even work? Would the needles hurt? Could it seriously get rid of the anxiety that even my Prozac failed to soothe?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to learn more about acupuncture for mental health, including whether it can help with heartbreak.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-acupuncture></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Acupuncture?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Acupuncture involves the insertion of tiny needles into specific areas on the body known as acupuncture points, according to Dr. Shari Auth, DACM, LAC, LMT, a leading holistic health practitioner and co-founder of New York City-based acupuncture studio <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Wthn</a>, the cozy and chic, spa-like facility where I received my treatments. This practice, which is a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), dates back some 3,000 years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The premise: "TCM believes that our internal body is similar to our external world," Dr. Auth tells me. "The same way forces of nature need to find balance, so do our bodies. The balance of life force energies, such as yin and yang, all need to be in balance both in quantity and quality to have true health." In TCM, imbalance translates to illness, Dr. Auth explains. So when you're suffering from something, whether it's chronic pain, digestion problems, tight muscles, stress, or yes, even, heartbreak, acupuncture aims to get you back to equilibrium.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you aren't currently experiencing any of the above symptoms, Dr. Auth says the treatment is actually preventative, so you can "keep yourself healthy and tackle problems, like stress, before they manifest as chronic conditions with physical symptoms."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oh, and by the way, the needles are pretty much painless (though this will depend on your pain tolerance and the type of needle used). Occasionally, I felt a pinch depending on the spot, but after a minute, the sensation dissipated, and I melted into the blanketed, heated, table.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-acupuncture-improve-mental-health></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can Acupuncture Improve Mental Health?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're currently doubting the effectiveness of acupuncture when it comes to treating issues like stress or anxiety, you're not alone. I was very cynical going into my first treatment. I kind of secretly thought it might be a hoax — I wasn't sure I believed in the whole good juju, holistic approach thing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turns out I was wrong. While more high-quality studies are still needed on the topic, studies in rats have shown an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>increase in serotonin levels</a> after just 20 minutes of treatment — with levels remaining elevated up to 120 minutes after the treatment. And a 2021 meta-analysis of twenty randomized controlled trials published in the Annals of General Psychiatry found that acupuncture had a positive effect on patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Acupuncture activates the release of "happy" hormones" and inhibitory amino acids like GABA which give you a feeling of well-being and relaxation, says Dr. Auth. Put another way? "Think of it as instant and effortless <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>meditation</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Serotonin is a key chemical that is known to help stabilize our mood and give us feelings of happiness," adds Andy Felton, Ph.D., assistant professor and licensed counselor at the University of Wisconsin. "So if you can release more serotonin, you may feel less sad and feel like your emotions are more manageable or balanced."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-acupuncture-help-you-heal-from-a-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can Acupuncture Help You Heal From a Breakup?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for helping to heal heartbreak specifically, Dr. Auth also notes that after a breakup (or um, after hearing our ex has moved on), our minds are often stuck on an endless loop of the same thoughts. "Not only can acupuncture help to relax the mind, but it also stimulates the release of chemicals similar to being in love," she explains. "When we are in love, our bodies release serotonin and dopamine. Once these same hormones are released with acupuncture, we are reminded that it is possible to feel good again without our ex and we begin to move on."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Felton agrees that the key to moving on is realizing that one person or relationship doesn't hold the key to these pleasurable serotonin-fueled feelings. "These chemicals are released in all kinds of situations" — for instance, by exercising, spending time in the sunshine, meditating, and yes, acupuncture — "they are not specific to relationships," he says.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Dr. Shari Auth, DACM, LAC, LMT</h3><p>"When we are in love, our bodies release serotonin and dopamine. Once these same hormones are released with acupuncture, we are reminded that it is possible to feel good again without our ex and we begin to move on."</p><p>— Dr. Shari Auth, DACM, LAC, LMT</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've ever gone through a breakup, you may already know it doesn't just come with emotional distress — it's possible to feel physical pain from heartbreak because our "physical and emotional bodies are linked," explains Rachel E. Nanney, MS, LPC-S, a licensed counselor for Texas-based <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Connections Wellness Group</a>. "When one is off, the other one can be affected," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since acupuncture has traditionally been used to restore balance to our body's flow of energy, it can relieve some of that emotionally-charged tension. "Many therapists are now incorporating the belief that humans store emotional pain on an energetic level in our physical bodies," Nanney explains. "Acupuncture can trigger a release of those emotions that have been stored in the body as well as increase feelings of positivity, wellness, and grounded energy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Auth agrees that acupuncture can treat the physical pain that can accompany a breakup — as well as those sleepless nights and loss of appetite that can come with the territory. "Whether it's a pit in the stomach or tight shoulders, acupuncture can relax the muscles and reduce inflammation to support emotional and physical wellness," she explains. "Acupuncture also helps to reduce stress and its effects on the digestive system and eating habits," says Dr. Auth.I can attest it really did loosen that knot in my stomach that I'd felt ever since my ex re-entered my brain, and my sleep has improved too — both imperative parts of recovery.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-acupoints-to-target-post-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Acupoints to Target Post-Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OK, so now for the fun part: my sessions. My initial visit to Wthn felt more like a therapy session: I spilled my guts, oversharing all the gory details about my broken heart that refused to mend. When I came to, I thought, "Wow, I just hit her with all the details of my sad love life for no reason." But little did I know, that all of this information was helping Dr. Auth map out the appropriate acupoints for me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A quick reminder from earlier: specific spots on the body target certain concerns. So for my issues (anxiety, depression, OCD, all amplified by heartbreak), there were a select number of acupoints that were important to hit: Spleen 6, Taiyang, and Pericardium 6. And you can actually reap the benefits of targeting these spots at home, without any needles.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Spleen 6</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This point is located above the inside of your ankle and will target your spleen in order to balance hormones and reduce stress, according to Dr. Auth. You can find it about a palm's distance (three inches) above your inner ankle. For at-home practice, Dr. Auth says you can "rub the area between the shinbone and the back of the calf taking 10 long, slow, deep breaths." Repeat on the other side.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Taiyang</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This point is meant to calm your mind and is located at your temples. According to Dr. Auth, the temples have been treated for thousands of years and can also address headaches. Try it sans needles by placing your index and middle fingers on the temples before rubbing in a circular motion while "slowly breathing in and out for ten deep breaths." Next, Dr. Auth says to "rest your fingers in the center of your temples and hold the point for two more deep breaths."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pericardium 6</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This acupoint is on the inside of your wrist "between the two ropey tendons a couple of inches up from the wrist," says Dr. Auth. It's famously known for helping with motion sickness but can also "soothe anxiety and promote deeper sleep." For a quick fix, press your thumb to the point with firm, yet comfortable, pressure while taking 10 deep breaths. Then move on to the other wrist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Acupuncture has many other benefits, even if you're not suffering from anxiety or depression. Reference the graphic below to find the acupuncture pressure points respective to your qualms.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Wthn</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-soon-does-acupuncture-begin-to-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Soon Does Acupuncture Begin to Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So you probably don't want to hear this, but the answer is it varies, and it may take time. Everyone is different and the healing process may be hindered or helped by outside factors. That being said, Dr. Auth says while you can expect to feel "lifted and rejuvenated" after each session, it can take several weeks to months to feel its full effects. Your acupuncturist will work with you to create a customized plan of action to help you kickstart the healing process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Personally, I noticed a difference after about three or four sessions, besides the immediate gratification of deep relaxation and escape from everyday stressors that came with each visit. I just felt lighter, happier, and more hopeful. I looked forward to each treatment and would leave the studio feeling rejuvenated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a couple of months, there was a serious decrease in my anxiety. It's important to note that I've also paired my acupuncture practices with talk therapy and medication, as well as journaling, and occasional meditation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-acupuncture-is-not-a-replacement-for-other-mental-health-treatments></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Acupuncture Is Not a Replacement for Other Mental Health Treatments</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All the experts unanimously agreed on this one: acupuncture is not a replacement for other mental health treatments, like traditional talk therapy, which can provide new coping skills to help restore and maintain the balance people are looking for after a breakup, Felton says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So as you'd expect, while plenty of psychotherapists, like Tina B. Tessina, Ph.D., author of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr. Romance's Guide to Finding Love Today</a>, believe in the benefits of acupuncture, they also believe it's imperative to combine it with help from a mental health pro. "If the emotion isn't talked about, it won't be properly released, and the relief will be temporary," she tells me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, if you're already in therapy, adding acupuncture into the mix can potentially amplify its effects and release any emotions that have become "backed-up", Nanney says. Coupling therapy with acupuncture — or even trigger point massage, bodywork, breathwork, yoga, guided imagery meditation, EFT (tapping) — can all "help process deeper trauma or even help balance certain surface-level emotion," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Auth agrees that the best mode of treatment is to combine both therapy and TCM practices like acupuncture. "Talk therapy can cut to the heart of the issue, raise awareness and give you the tools to change deeply rooted behavior, whereas acupuncture can alter your brain chemistry and help you release the past and move into the present moment," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line-on-acupuncture-for-a-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line on Acupuncture for a Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a few months of weekly sessions, I can report that my anxiety is much less severe and frequent. I feel happier and more confident — Dr. Auth even told me I was glowing (hey, I'll take it!). Not to mention, I barely care or think about my ex these days; hell, I even have a new boyfriend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So has acupuncture cured my OCD and rid me of anxiety? No, of course not. But it doesn't need to — I'm not looking for a quick fix. But did it help me accept and come to terms with the things that I cannot change? Absolutely. Did it allow me to finally move on from my past relationship trauma? You bet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Supplementing my existing mental health practices with acupuncture has given me that additional release of serotonin and dopamine to help me on my journey to happiness. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, everyone responds differently to treatment — acupuncture may change your life or you might not experience any noticeable results. All I know is it can't hurt (really, it doesn't hurt) to give it a try. At the very least, you'll get a nice relaxing session that may even lead to falling asleep on the table ("We call this an acu-nap!" says Dr. Auth).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWmrcutn2aemam7pr%2FSaJicraCqu6TA1KucZpqimq6swc%2BsZKadnqmurXnHnpilrJg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
