The word is derived from the Greek words ‘agalma’ which means ‘statue’ and ‘philia’ which means ‘love.’ This is a unique kind of paraphilia where statues, dolls, or mannequins sexually arouse an individual. The attraction might include a desire for sexual interaction with the object, fantasizing about sexual encounters with it, etc. It is also known as the statue syndrome. And, it has been stated to be different from Pygmalionism where artists have sexual desire for their creations and want them to turn into reality.</p><p>It is also different from fetishism as it does not have an attraction towards a particular body part of the statue. They are attracted to the whole statue for the fulfillment of their <a href=#>sexual desire</a>, or they establish a personal relationship with the statue as a statue. It is a very rare condition with infrequent mentions in history. Also, there is no mention in today’s standard works of erotomania and psychiatry.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Hierarchy of needs: Human Love and Belongingness explained by Abraham Maslow</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Historical Context</h4><p>It has been a point of duality for historians and researchers to include pygmalionism as a type of agalmatophilia. Pygmalion was a Greek sculptor who fell in love with the statue he created. In Greek mythology, Pygmalion saw Propeutides prostituting themselves. He then lost sexual interest in women. Legend has it that later he carved a statue so realistic that he fell in love with it. He prayed to Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of love) to bring the statue to life. To which Aphrodite granted the wish later, and Pygmalion married the woman who was once a statue. Considering alagmatophilia, there have been several instances in Greek mythology with his condition. With no actual evidence regarding the existence of this stories, one can only find some truth.</p><p>One of the famous accounts states that, in mid 4th century BC, cnidians purchased a sculptor of Aphrodite and placed it in a temple offering a front and rear view of the sculpture. There was a young boy who was said to be fallen in love with the sculpture and come to the temple every day to speak with it. Later in the evening he hid behind the door during closing time and had intercourse with the statue. Once there remained a mark on the thigh of the statue, which revealed his deed. Then, the next morning he ran from the temple and died by falling off a cliff.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Agalmatophilia in Academic Discourse and Case Studies</h4><p>Most of the academic writings for this condition are either historical writings or case studies. One of the first academically documented case study was reported by Richard Vonn Kraft-Ebbing in his 1877 text Psychopathlia Sexualis. Here, Kraft-Ebbing recorded a case of a male gardener who developed feelings for the statue of Venus De Milo and was caught attempting to have sex with it. Dr. Brenda Love in her 2005 book chapter has mentioned 2-3 more case studies regarding the condition. She also states that in an algomatomaniac, sexual stimulation comes more from a need for control and sexual pleasure without an emotional response from either partner. It can easily be misinterpreted as a superficial, cruel, and cold way of describing sexual stimulation, and while that may be the case for some, it is not the case for everyone.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Valentine’s Day: Let’s Celebrate the Love and Mental Health Positivity</a></strong></p><p>Some people use agalmatophilia as a way to perform derogatory acts without actually hurting anyone. Agalmatophilia can be hard to understand, especially when you consider the mental state behind these fantasies. But always think about whether the actions hurt real people or not. Some people use it as a derogatory fantasy. Others use it for sexual gratification that comes from loneliness or lack of confidence in their ability to find a mate.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Possible Causal Factors:</h5><p>The psychology behind agalmatophilia is not fully understood. But it is likely to include various psychological, social, and maybe some neurological factors. Let us explore some of them.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Objectification And Control:</h5><p>This condition may stem from a desire to control and objectify the object of desire. Inanimate objects like statues and mannequins do not<br>have free will or autonomy as they are non-living. This allows the individual to be dominant and exert complete control over the object.<br></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Fantasy And Imagination:</h5><p>for some individuals, the appeal of agalmatophilia may lie in the realm of fantasy and imagination. Statues and mannequins are made or can be made as you want, they represent ideal or perfect forms, which allows individuals to project their desire onto the object without the fear and complexities of human relationships.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Trauma And Conditioning:</h5><p>Experiencing trauma can cause people to create coping strategies to handle challenging emotions or situations. Some individuals might seek solace in unconventional or fetishistic sexual desires like agalmatophilia, where an individual develops it as a means of dealing with trauma and restoring a feeling of power and security. Some individuals also may have early emotional attachments with dolls and figurines when they were kids which later result in sexual arousal to similar objects in adulthood.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Why do People Fall in Love?</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Social Factors:</h5><p>Cultural and societal influences may play a significant role in the development of agalmatophilia. Cultural beliefs, attitudes, and practices surrounding sexuality can influence individuals’ sexual interests and behavior. Also, exposure to media like movies, television shows, and advertising, might influence the individual’s perception of sexuality and attractiveness. For example, some cultures might have art, literature, or religious practices that depict or celebrate humans like statues or figures in a sexualized manner, which may be a contributing factor to the development of the condition.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Neurological Factors:</h5><p>While research in this area is limited, we can say that there might be underlying neurological differences or brain abnormalities in individuals with agalmatophilia. These differences could influence how the brain processes and respond to sexual stimuli. Like in some individuals, it can impact the brain reward system including areas like neural accumbens and ventral tegmental area. These parts are responsible for experiencing pleasure and reinforcing behavior linked to rewarding stimuli. For these individuals engaging in statues might activate this reward pathway and strengthen the attraction to non-living objects.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>In Modern Era:</h5><p>As mentioned there hasn’t been much research on this subject of paraphilia. But there have been incidences where we can still find some cases of it. In this modern era, we cannot find many people artistically inclined people who get obsessed with their creations to have a sexual desire or a form of personal human relationship with them. But what we can find are real life-like humanoid figurines like sex dolls to provide sexual gratification and companionship. These industries are not targeted at individuals with agalmatophilia, but we can say that this sex doll or figurines can appeal to individuals with sexual attraction towards inanimate objects.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Interesting psychology behind first love</a></strong></p><p>It is important to understand that alagmatophilia like other paraphilias exists on a spectrum and varies in intensity. And not all people who are attracted to inanimate objects will interpret them similarly or for the same motives. Like people with any paraphilia, it is important for individuals who feel troubled or affected by their unusual sexual preferences and desires to reach out to mental health experts. Mental health experts will offer to guide and help these individuals with empathy and acknowledgment.</p>References+<p>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-23397-001<br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agalmatophilia<br>https://doaj.org/article/e9b2135158d74a74b2535379aa9f20db<br>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5184/classicalj.110.4.0419</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Rising Back after SetBacks in Life</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding correlation between attachment styles and life satisfaction:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Navigating Life’s Transitions: Academics and Beyond</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychology behind Savings</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 29, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>What is Languishing?</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 29, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmmp%2BRobqiwM6pn6KkmZZ6psTCnqqsoaaaeq271Z5kn6eiYsCkwcupq56cXZeyosHTsmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
