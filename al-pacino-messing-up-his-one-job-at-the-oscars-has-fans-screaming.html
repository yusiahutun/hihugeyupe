It appeared Al Pacino didn’t understand his job at the Oscars last night. The movie icon was tasked with announcing the Best Picture award at the glitzy event. But instead of reading out the nominees, so the audience, full of celebrities, could applaud each one, he went off-script."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So he ended the night in a strange way indeed, and fans aren’t all mad, really.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-al-pacino-s-mistake-at-the-oscars>Al Pacino’s mistake at the Oscars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-2074737757-1024x683.jpg><p>Although most of the time the night goes off without a hitch *cough* <a href=#>Will Smith and Chris Rock</a> *cough*, there was one hitch last night.</p><p>Some of <a href=#>Hollywood</a>‘s best and brightest attended the event to celebrate the previous year’s worth of cinema.</p><p>One of the biggest award trophies to be handed out is the category for Best Picture. Killers of the Flower Moon, <a href=#>Barbie</a>, Poor Things and The Holdovers were nominated including Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.</p><p>Barbie and <a href=#>Oppenheimer</a> have been famously battling it out all season across other award shows, from the <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> to the SAG Awards. So this was one of the big nights to see who would take the statue home.</p><p>However, instead of listing the nominees before announcing the winner, Al Pacino just opened the Oscars envelope and said it.</p><p>His way of doing things has been labelled as ‘chaotic’ with viewers, with some fans saying they’re still ‘screaming’ over it.</p><p>One fan on <a href=#>Twitter</a> said: “I’m obsessed with the way Al Pacino announced&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;as Best Picture. Couldn’t have been more chaotic or confusing lol.”</p><p>A second added: “Al Pacino announced Best Picture like this was the first time he had ever heard of a film called&nbsp;Oppenheimer”.</p><p>A third wrote: “I’m still screaming at Al Pacino! He said eff the 10 movies that were nominated and just opened the envelope and named the winner!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m obsessed with the way Al Pacino announced Oppenheimer as Best Picture. couldn’t have been more chaotic or confusing lol</p><p>“Best Picture…uh, I have to go to the envelope for that. And I will. Here it comes. And my eyes see Oppenheimer?”<a href=#>#Oscars</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/a0hNQ4ZP7j</a></p>— Spencer Althouse (@SpencerAlthouse) <a href=#>March 11, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-but-fans-think-it-was-part-of-a-plan>But fans think it was part of a ‘plan’</h2><p>Barbie fans remember <a href=#>The Godfather</a> joke in the Greta Gerwig flick. After Ken has taken over Barbieland, the Barbies work to deprogram the others by distracting the Kens. We see President Barbie offering to watch The Godfather with one of them, and they say: “Oh my god, you’ve never seen The Godfather!”</p><p>It was pointing a finger at the traditional masculinity throughout the film and through Kens.</p><p>Therefore, fans think choosing Al Pacino to read out the Best Picture Oscars category, where Barbie and Oppenheimer were battling against each other again, was the perfect choice.</p><p>One fan wrote: “The Academy bringing Al Pacino, from The Godfather, to deliver the Best Picture Oscar to Oppenheimer instead of Barbie, a movie that mocked Kens’ obsession with The Godfather, is CRAZY”.</p><p>A second added: “My wife Claire’s Oscar take: after the&nbsp;Barbie&nbsp;scene mocking Ken’s love of&nbsp;The Godfather,&nbsp;it’s hard not to see the Academy’s choice of Al Pacino to present&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;with best picture as anything other than a MIDDLE FINGER to&nbsp;Barbie.”</p><p>While a third pondered: “I’m actually mad&nbsp;Barbie&nbsp;didn’t win best picture now even though I was [rooting] for&nbsp;Poor Things&nbsp;because can you imagine the absolute hilarity of Al Pacino presenting that after&nbsp;The Godfather&nbsp;joke in the movie, I mean come on??”</p><p>Although that doesn’t explain why he read out the card without the nominees. Perhaps he wanted to get straight to it over The Godfather joke? Who knows!</p><p>You do you, Al.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2Z%2BcK3LZqeam5mjvG65xKyqoqaXYsKxeceiqmannpp6q7vBZpitZaSdsm670pyYq6tdna60ecWapaxlo5i%2Fpq3MoqWgZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
