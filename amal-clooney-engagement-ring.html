Okay, not everyone is that gauche, but it still seems like the size (and price) of your engagement bling is something that, as a woman, you’re told is important from Day 1. He should spend a certain chunk of his annual salary on it, it should be at least 50 carats, and the list goes on."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It makes odd tasks around the house awkward, could attract unwarranted&nbsp;judgement&nbsp;at the office, and makes traveling with The Rock in plain sight something that induces heart palpitations.</p><p>But here’s some refreshing news. The gorgeous, intelligent&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Amal Clooney</a></strong> is reportedly looking to downgrade her own massive platinum-mounted diamond engagement ring, estimated to be worth more than $750,000.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>According to The Mirror</a>, the former Ms. Alamuddin, 37, has been shopping at Cartier for a simple platinum band. But why, exactly? Sources told the British tabloid that the prominent human rights lawyer simply doesn’t want undue attention drawn on her bling when she’s working on serious cases involving corruption or genocide. Makes sense, especially given her track record for <a href=#>artfully avoiding</a> unwanted media attention.</p><p>The source further adds that her new husband, (you know, movie star&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>George Clooney</a></strong>), is “completely supportive” of the decision of the “downgrade.” And it’s not like Amal’s getting rid of The Bling altogether, just looking for something a little less, well, blingy for her high-profile career.</p><p>Sure, downgrading might not be for everyone, but it’s definitely food for thought when you’re demanding that your boyfriend empty out his bank account for a piece of jewelry that, in the end, isn’t all that practical to wear outside of your engagement photos.</p><p>And besides, we now know that <a href=# rel=nofollow>the pricier the ring</a>, the higher the likelihood of divorce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9aem52hnpzAcIGPaWtta1%2BWuqK4jJyjqKeemsZusc2gmKCdnZq7tXnRoqWgZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
