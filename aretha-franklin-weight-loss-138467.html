(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>Aretha has been open about struggling with weight loss throughout her more than 60-year music career. In the early 1970s, she suddenly dropped 40 pounds during a crash diet. She again lost weight in the early 1990s before soon gaining it back. In 1992, Aretha quit smoking and said her weight subsequently “ballooned.” She has additionally been treated for several undisclosed illnesses over the years which have led to weight losses and gains. We hope Aretha’s latest weight loss is just attributed to her maintaining a healthy lifestyle!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46aqZ6smJZ6p77Ap6KloZ5ixKa1xqGrZqSfqMBufZJxa29vXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
