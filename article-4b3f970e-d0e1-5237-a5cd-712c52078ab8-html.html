Cayden Zade Magee, 2, of Collins died Friday afternoon after the car he was riding in with his mother, 21-year-old Kelsey Eubanks, was struck by a dump truck and went up an embankment and hit a tree just south of Ellisville.
Eubanks suffered “moderate” injuries, but CPR was being performed on Cayden before they were transported by EMServ to Forrest General Hospital."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was later transferred to a Jackson hospital by Lifeflight, but he died later that evening just before Eubanks went in to surgery for a broken ankle. She was later released.</p><p>Family friend Hillary Odom said Cayden was “one of the most spoiled rotten, loving little boys” she’s ever met. He loved big trucks and SpongeBob. The friend said anyone who knew him knew that he was a momma’s boy.</p><p>“He loved his mommy more than anyone else and was so attached to her that he would never even stay with other people,” Odom said.</p><p>Eubanks said she will never be the same without Cayden and doesn’t know how to go on.</p><p>“I miss him so much,” she said. “Everything reminds me of him. I miss him running out of his room telling me he wants to watch SpongeBob.”</p><p>Cayden, who would have turned 3 in June, was the son of Eubanks and Brad Magee, both of Collins.</p><p>There was a booster seat in the back seat of the car but it was not known if the toddler was buckled in. Rescue officials said the child hit the windshield. According to state law, children under 4 are required to be buckled in a car seat with a five point hitch.</p><p>The Mississippi Highway Patrol, Jones County Fire Coordinator Dan McKenna, the Jones County Emergency Management Agency, volunteers from other departments and District Attorney’s Office Investigator Wayne Black responded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwuM6cmKVnpKSxpbjEq2SdoZWoeqKy056pZqFdaoZur9GaqqFnkafBqq%2FLnpZtmmObhnh8xGabaZ1hYoJzf5ZmmG6blGKEcn7Cbmlpb2iWr3l6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
