The quality of the application packet gives me confidence that this project is going to be as successful as the others.”</p><p>The total cost of the second phase of the project is $665,821 with $540,000 coming from federal funds and Jones College providing the remaining 20 percent. In addition to adding the sidewalks, which will be ADA-compliant, the improvements will enhance connectivity between the surrounding buildings and recreational facilities on the south side of JC’s campus, allowing for safe travel across the streets from the dorms and stadiums.</p><p>“The TAP Grant program helps us leverage those available funds with the help of Transportation Commissioner Busby,” Smith said. “We’re thankful Commissioner Busby hand-delivered the check and informed us we met the rigid protocols required to receive these funds.”</p><p>Phase 1 of the Stadium Circle Sidewalk Improvements from Smith Hall to the Sim Cooley/Bobcat Football Stadium should begin this summer, with the second phase of construction beginning in the summer of 2025.</p><p>Jones College was awarded the first TAP Grant to close the heavily traveled road in front of the C.L. Neill Student Center and Cafeteria to create the Pedestrian Plaza in 2017. The second and third TAP grants extended the plaza to include Dan Jones north and south and College Drive east in front of the A.B. Howard Gymnasium. The Soccer Pathway Project, which was completed in 2023, was created using funds from the fourth TAP grant secured by the college.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKKTn7CgusSwqmiapaivunnDnqOirpWnwG6yzqtko5tflr%2B1tcKlnJhvZZaBcn%2BTaWSdnGhtenJ9xJ5kcWpolnp4spebaG1skpqCcn%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
