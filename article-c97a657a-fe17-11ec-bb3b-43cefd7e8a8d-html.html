Landrum (Jami); seven grandchildren, Kelsie Sullivan (Aaron), Hayden Landrum (Bryce), Allen Landrum, Kacy Landrum, Brianna Landrum, Hannah Dennis and Josh Dennis; great-granddaughter Ashlynn “Tabbycat” Green; and sisters Sue Ross and Judy McIntosh.</p><p>Gail was a homemaker most of her life. There were times that she attempted to work outside the home and she even went back to school for a time, with the intention of becoming an elementary school teacher, but her passion for her family always led her back home. She truly believed her place was at home taking care of her husband and her children, and she did that job selflessly.</p><p>Gail and Darrell were married at the age of 16 and together built a beautiful family legacy based on faith, hope and love. Gail loved Darrell all her days and always stood by his side. In her last few years, she enjoyed their ministry of singing for their Lord together as “Blessed,” because they always said they knew they were.</p><p>Gail was what you might call a true “Mama Bear.” If you wanted to see the fighting side of her, just mess with one of her children or grandchildren. She loved her family deeply, but she loved her Lord and Savior even more. Gail, Mama, Granny and Granny Gail will be greatly missed.</p><p>Visitation will Monday, July 11, from noon to 2 p.m. with service to follow at 2 p.m. at Charity Free Will Baptist Church at 1848 Mill Creek Road in Laurel. Burial will follow in Myrick Cemetery. Rev. Gary M. Walters will officiate.</p><p>Pallbearers will be Micheal Landrum, Hayden Landrum, Dee McIntosh, Neil Drennan, Nathan Brooks and Marty Dearman. Honorary pallbearer will be Allen Landrum.</p><p>To sign the online guestbook, visit <a href=#><span>www.memorychapellaurel.com</span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnnZa%2FtLTAZp6aoZxir7O7wJ2fnpmUYrmiusOrrKZnkafBqq%2FLnpaccWeWg3aDwGadnmlnYn5yscJmmZtrkmKBdK%2FEn5twnWiWhaV6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
