Anderson has an EP out and has all the earmarks of someone with an amazing future but, at the same time, she has been streamed more than 25 million times, played the Grand Ole Opry five times and <span><a href=#>has lunch with Reba</a></span>. She even signed her record deal while onstage at the Ryman Auditorium.</p><p>Anderson is about to head out on the road with Rob Thomas and might very well be one of the most outgoing newcomers in the Music City scene. She just launched her new single, “Good Lord,” below, and was a belle of the ball on Stagecoach’s social media.</p><p></p><p><strong>So is something going on here? Do you feel like there might be a “thing” happening regarding your career?</strong></p><p>Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Joe. The only thing I can say to that is, yes, I definitely believe in the 10,000-hour rule. I think I’ve put those in playing piano from such a young age and just continuing to work hard and, honestly, to ask a bunch of questions. I’m on tour with other artists and am trying to learn everything I can from them. I can only hope to keep getting better at my craft. That’s what this is about.</p><p><strong>But you’ve been on the Opry stage five times</strong></p><p>Five times! What the heck? Can you believe that? I can’t believe that. What’s going on?</p><p>I met the Opry family even before I had music out, I think. They’re so supportive of new artists. When I met them, they took me in. I truly feel this way: that I made my debut very early on. Probably earlier than I should have, and it’s all thanks to them, just taking a chance on me and investing in me early on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So how in the heck does one even get started with that?</strong></p><p>My label, Black River, took me over to the Opry early last year. That was the first time for me being backstage at the Opry so, of course, in my mind, you know, this is amazing. A business meeting. I’ll play songs for them but also I was starstruck. “I’m backstage at the Opry! What the heck?” Just seeing all the dressing rooms. But I just played for a couple of people, got them familiar with my face. But, man, I just have the best team. I don’t know how many calls happened or when they happened but all I know since that meeting, September came around and I had my first single out. I literally got a call one day from Mr. Jordan from the Opry asking if I’d like to make my debut.</p><p>So, from an artist’s perspective, it’s just a phone call, right? But I can’t imagine how many phone calls happened in between.</p><p><strong>And you’ve also done shows at the Ryman. I don’t want to get confused.</strong></p><p>Yes, sir. The Opry also does shows at the Ryman. I actually got to sign my record deal on the Ryman stage. And I love Ms. Sally. (i.e., Sally Williams)</p><p><strong>You got a standing ovation at the O2. What is missing from the video?</strong></p><p>Oh, the song? Man, I like to think I’ve put in 10-out-of-10 energy into every single song I play during a set but I always end the night with a song called “The Naked Truth.” It’s the last song on my EP and, man, I don’t know what it is about that song. There is literally a line that says, “Wham, bam, Instagram / She never should have posted that with my man.” So it’s not like I’m spitting out lyrically genius lines or anything, ok? But for some reason that song just gets the crowd going, gets them on their feet, gets their fists pumpin’ in the air. It’s just a good time.</p><p></p><p><strong>How did you meet your agent?</strong></p><p>This is a fun story. I moved to Nashville when I was 17 and I first met my CAA agent, Kylen Sharpe. And she was throwing me gigs when she shouldn’t have been, OK? I was 17, didn’t have a label, didn’t have a manager. She was just doing me favors, helping me get better at my craft. And then I signed with Black River.</p><p>I met Kylen when I was probably 15. It was the first time I made trips to Nashville. I was just a young girl with stars in my eyes, thinking that every song I had was a big ol’ hit. Kylen was a big reason why I moved to Nashville. She just gave me the confidence, that I’d meet the right people, that I’d be OK. Because of her, I started playing gigs in town. The more gigs, the more face recognition. Through that, I met two song pluggers, Liz Morin, and Ronna Reeves, who got me in the door at Black River. And, gosh darn it, they signed me. I always knew everything in life was a team effort but you don’t realize the extent until you literally have people, you know, trying to help make your dream come true.</p><p>If there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s surrounding myself with individuals who are a whole lot smarter than I am. I’m very thankful for them.</p><p><strong>How about your manager?</strong></p><p>I was on a manager hunt last year and someone suggested I meet with Will Ward. I knew he was my guy right off the bat. The man is genius. Thinks outside of the box, doesn’t have the word “can’t” in his vocabulary and has an amazing company, Fourward, that is so much more than music. He manages huge actors, produces movies and understands the importance of hiring brilliant minds. My day to day manager, Alicia Jones is exactly that. I feel smarter, wiser and more powerful with them backing me up. It really is my dream team.</p><p></p><p><strong>You seem like such a kind person that it would be natural for you to do meet and greets.</strong></p><p>I love meet and greets.</p><p><strong>You just seem like you’d be a natural.</strong></p><p>I appreciate that. I’m not going to lie. There are days when your voice is going out, when you’re done playing a gig and you’re sweaty and the thought of taking pictures is tiring. But I always promised myself that I always would because what’s the point of making music if nobody’s going to listen to it? And I want to meet everybody who’s paying money to come see me. I mean, holy cow. People actually pay money to come see me do what I love. That is an absolute honor, and I want them to feel as loved and as important as they make me feel. I think that’s part of the job.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hey, that’s how Taylor Swift built up a career.</strong></p><p>Exactly.
