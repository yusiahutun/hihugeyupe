My mother was a caterer, and from around the age of 13, I started to help her. I found it exciting, and I loved the banter that goes on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I also learned cooking at high school. And, as a good Aussie boy, I did a lot of barbecuing. I think that the kitchen is an exciting place for kids. Helping makes you feel like a grown-up. When I left school, I was offered an apprenticeship in a restaurant in Perth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is hard to say. In the early days, when I first arrived in London, it would have to be Marco [Pierre White]. He was like a rock star. He had a look, an attitude, and he had beautiful women hanging off him. That didn't happen to chefs before him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My first Michelin meal was at his restaurant, Harvey's. I went to work for one of his former sous chefs. All together, it cemented the feeling that being a chef was for me.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cuisine is now modern European, and there has been an increase in quality and consistency. There is a focus on using regional ingredients. We are also working with two local suppliers for organic produce, and have bought some land in the New Territories. We are building a greenhouse, a beehive and a wormery [for compost]. The aim is to grow foods that we can't find locally that I like to work with. Normally, they would be imported from Europe. Things like Jerusalem artichokes and obscure herbs such as sweet cicely.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: All's well that ends swell for globetrotting chef</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9mfXaDl25raJmjoHqnu86doJ5lo52ur7GMqKqbp6Kj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
