Hair care expert Philip Kingsley formulated the Elasticizer ($48, Amazon) for Audrey long before he sold it as part of his eponymous haircare brand. “Audrey came to see Philip in 1974. She was doing a lot of filming, and her hair was in terrible condition because of all the styling and coloring they were doing on set,” Philip’s daughter, Anabel Kingsley, told Glamour."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Turns out, that’s all thanks to one product created specifically for her, which is still available for purchase decades later.</p><p>Hair care expert Philip Kingsley formulated the Elasticizer (<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">$48, Amazon</a>) for Audrey long before he sold it as part of his eponymous haircare brand. “Audrey came to see Philip in 1974. She was doing a lot of filming, and her hair was in terrible condition because of all the styling and coloring they were doing on set,” Philip’s daughter, Anabel Kingsley, told <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>. “So she went to see him and requested a moisturizing treatment that wasn’t going to weigh her hair down, as she had quite fine hair. They were using all these heavy creams post-shampoo and her hair was just flat. So she was like, ‘What can you give me that’s going to give me body and put my hair in better condition?'”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>So Philip went to his lab and emerged with the Elasticizer, which is said to be the first pre-shampoo conditioning treatment. According to the official <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Philip Kingsley website</a>, Elasticizer’s ingredients help restore elasticity and “bounce” to damaged hair by reducing breakage and restoring manageability. This product only needs to be applied once per week, and it can be used on very fine hair — like Audrey’s — without weighing it down.</p><p>Audrey loved this product so much that she ordered pots of it to be shipped to Switzerland while she was living there so she would never run out, and she wound up using it for the rest of her life. Before long, Philip brought Elasticizer out as a permanent product that the rest of the public could enjoy.</p><p>While the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">line of Elasticizer products</a> run a bit pricey — such as the lovely geranium-scented version (<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">$52.31, Amazon</a>) — you can try out a small 75 mL sample of the classic (<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">$23, Amazon</a>) to see if it suits you. Who knows? You may love it just as much as Audrey did!</p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.
