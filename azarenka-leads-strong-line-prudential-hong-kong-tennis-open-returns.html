Holder of 21 WTA singles titles, Victoria Azarenka returns to Hong Kong after almost 15 years to the Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open, which returns next week after a five-year break. The former world No.1 and twice Australian Open singles winner will have to be at the top of her game to stand a chance of reaching the final on Sunday, October 15, at the Victoria Park Tennis Stadium."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The former world No.1 and twice Australian Open singles winner will have to be at the top of her game to stand a chance of reaching the final on Sunday, October 15, at the Victoria Park Tennis Stadium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At a recent launch event for the tournament, President of the Hong Kong, China Tennis Association (HKCTA) Philip Mok expressed gratitude to the tournament’s title sponsor, Prudential Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong SAR Government. Recognised as an “M” Mark event, the week-long Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open represents a spectacular and signature event in the city’s sports calendar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawrence Lam, Chief Executive Officer of Prudential Hong Kong Limited, said the company is proud to have supported this prestigious WTA tournament since 2014. “It is a privilege to be the title sponsor and to welcome some of the world’s leading tennis stars for nine days of intense competition,” he said. “Our partnership with the HKCTA aims to inspire more people in Hong Kong to pick up a racquet and embrace a healthy, active lifestyle.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prudential celebrates its 175th anniversary as a world-renowned health protection and financial services provider this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2023/10/09/SCMP-Photo-8---PC-group-photo.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a five-year break, the Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open is again attracting a world-class field of players this year. Azarenka, 34, will no doubt find many of the competitors familiar. High-ranking Brazilian Beatriz Haddad Maia, 27, was a Roland Garros semi-finalist this year. The duo know each other well as they paired up as doubles partners at the start of the year before taking the clay-court WTA 1000 Madrid Open doubles title in May.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the company of Azarenka and Maia are some promising young players. Canadian Leylah Fernandez, 21, was a US Open finalist in 2021, having defeated en route to the final defending champion Naomi Osaka, Angelique Kerber, Elina Svitolina, and Aryna Sabalenka.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also aged 22 and a former junior world No.1, China’s Wang Xiyu is an in-form player. She won her maiden WTA Tour singles title on home soil in Guangzhou last month, beating top seed Magda Linette in a straight-set win. Currently ranked world No.38, Wang did not lose a set during the tournament to claim the title.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2023/10/09/SCMP-Photo-7---Tennis-Stadium.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spectators at the Victoria Park Tennis Stadium will undoubtedly take note of the performance of a future star in the making. Mirra Andreeva, 16, recorded some sensational results over world-class players in the senior category at this year’s Madrid Open, Roland Garros and the Wimbledon. The teenage sensation played against and emerged triumphant over several top players participating in this year’s Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open. Will the spectators witness the highly anticipated rise of a future star, or will the likes of Maia and Fernandez make amends for their slips in their previous encounters?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The tournament will also feature top Hong Kong players. Eudice Chong and Cody Wong have been an impressive force in ITF Women’s Tennis Tour doubles. In the past few seasons, they won 22 world titles, and 11 of them lifted as a team. They are also near their career high in WTA singles rankings, with Chong comfortably within the world’s top 250 and Wong just outside the top 300.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2023/10/09/SCMP-Photo-4---Mini-Tennis-Court.JPG?itok=SuuzFVAd"><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An internationally renowned stop on the WTA calendar and an important fixture of the Asian swing, the Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open is beloved by players and fans alike. In fact, tournament players voted its previous edition as the 2018 WTA International Tournament of the Year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As in its previous editions, this year’s Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open will offer more than top-class tennis. Staying true to the tournament’s tagline of “Celebrating Greatness,” it will be a week-long festival of tennis, entertainment, and community engagement.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The popular, free-entry Tournament Village located adjacent to the Victoria Park Tennis Stadium, boasts an array of tennis-themed activities and entertainment for all ages. These include a mini-tennis court with coaching clinics and demonstrations, a serve speed booth, and tennis game booths. There will be food and refreshments on offer as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2023/10/09/SCMP-Photo-5---Merchandise.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, the tournament collaborates with two artists — Polish artist Mateusz Kolek and a local artist from creative studio Ztoryteller — to create unique merchandise items that integrate culture and sport. The items will be available for purchase in the Tournament Village.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Title sponsor Prudential’s booth is family-friendly, bringing visitors tennis games and photo opportunities. Meanwhile, fans can get up close and personal with their favourite players at the autograph booth.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A fascinating aspect of the tournament is that some of the matches are for free, on a first-come, first-served basis. The Main draw matches on Courts 1 and 2, are to be open to the public free of charge. There are again free entries on the “People’s Monday” on October 9 and for full-time students on October 10 as part of the “Student’s Tuesday.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To enjoy the more intense competition experience as the tournament progresses, tennis fans can now purchase the tournament’s tickets online at Hong Kong Ticketing. So be in the thick of world-class tennis action in the heart of Hong Kong, and be the first to find out who follows in the footsteps of previous Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open winners such as Dayana Yastremska, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Caroline Wozniacki, Jelena Jankovic, and Sabine Lisicki.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbOx0p6lrZ2UZMCxu9GtZq2noJ6wtHvPq6ydnZ6ptqK4jK2cp6aZqHqwvMSnZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlsb2JqfnCt2ZqpnqablnqtscCdqmarpKe8r7OMpaCnnV2lv7awxKeropmcYrWwusZmoqiml2LBprrNoqpmp6Cau26%2BxK2sq6aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
