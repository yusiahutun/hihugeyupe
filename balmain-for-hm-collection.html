One shopper at the Champs-Elysées store in Paris lined up at 2 PM yesterday,&nbsp;<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/olivier-rousteing-hm-champs-elysees-store-10274088/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WWD reports" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WWD reports</a>, while a few minor arguments broke out at the Regent Street store in London, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/05/hm-balmain-designer-fashion-launch-scuffles-regent-street data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Online, H&M's site crashed soon after the 8 AM launch, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://footwearnews.com/2015/influencers/collaborations/balmain-hm-collection-shoes-sold-out-167981/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Footwear News reports" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Footwear News reports</a>, and the whole collection was almost sold out when the site returned around 9. Predictably, pieces have already cropped up on eBay, where some are priced at twice their retail value.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shoppers attribute the frenzy to the popularity of the Kardashians—"I got the white blazer that Jordan Dunn wore, the basic T-shirt and another black blazer that Kim Kardashian was wearing. Seeing them in the clothes definitely influenced my decision to come here," one shopper told WWD—while other customers point to the appeal of Balmain creative director (and Instagram star) Olivier Rousteing. "I'm a huge fan of the designer himself, but not the celebrities who took part in the campaign. I couldn't care less about Kendall Jenner," said another shopper.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Update, 10/29: </strong>With less than a week until Balmain x H&M officially launches in stores, the full video campaign&nbsp;is finally here. Featuring Kendall Jenner leading a futuristic subway dance-off and Olivier Rousteing orchestrating the trains&nbsp;through some fancy, tech-y touchscreens, this is the kind of subway performance we can get behind. Although Kendall seemingly danced more in the behind-the-scenes video, the model still holds her own while playing&nbsp;ring-leader to a&nbsp;pack of dancers—offering up a few dance moves (literally only three) of her own.

In the short new&nbsp;clip, Routsteing's model muse Kendall Jenner learns to dance for the collaboration campaign video. Jenner leads a&nbsp;pack of models dancing in subway cars and down futuristic metro hallways, with moves inspired by Michael Jackson's "Bad" music video.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rousteing also spoke out about Kendall Jenner facing the campaign in an exclusive interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.yahoo.com/style/kendall-jenner-olivier-rousteing-learn-1281437292003382.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Yahoo Style" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Yahoo Style</a>, comparing her to the likes of the iconic '90s supers,&nbsp;"She is an icon. I'm inspired by her. For me she is the new Naomi, Claudia, Cindy. You know the type of models where people want to be her. Finally we go back to top models and are making dream girls."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And when it comes to the Balmain Army, the designer revealed that he thinks Kendall Jenner is the most important face, "Kendall had a lot of fun. It was a new experience for her. We had the best time. It was new for both of us. But more importantly, the campaign has to reflect the Balmain Army and for me, she is the most important. She also has an amazing soul and is so supportive. It is important for me to have my friends around me to support every project that I do. She's just amazing and inspires an entire generation. I love that she's global, and loves music, dancing, she's the Balmain girl."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch the behind-the-scenes video below:<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Update, 10/9: </strong>With less than a month until the highly-anticipated Balmain x&nbsp;H&M collection&nbsp;debut, 99 images of the collaboration appear to have leaked online.
