A good hair day can make all the difference from turning an average day to an exceptional one, and on days when you’re just not feeling your look, clip-in hair extensions can instantly help to give your hair more body, length, or even a brand new style, like a high pony.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Popping on some luscious clip-in extensions will get you salon-worthy looks from the comfort of your bedroom. You can style, reuse, and customize the clip-ins to create various hairstyles. And the best part? They last for years before needing to be replaced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet, shopping for hair extensions can feel like a single-footed dance, as you’ll need to consider a variety of hair types, textures, colors and styles in order to find your perfect match. To simplify the shopping process, we handpicked 21 of the most popular clip-in extensions out there and tested 16 for ourselves. We tested the extensions over four weeks out in the real world and we judged each one based on their ease of use and attachment, comfort, variety of shades, and the overall final look. These are the eight best clip-in extensions that came out on top, according to our testers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-hidden-crown-hair-extensions-crown-clip-ins></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hidden Crown Hair Extensions Crown Clip-Ins</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hidden Crown Hair Extensions Crown Clip-Ins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OdZdKoTDblyOjzPPeOMUWtWWQv8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hidden-crown-hair-extensions-crown-clip-ins-74a1edda5d344941b81e320ab8a7e809.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hidden Crown</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The clip-in hair extensions from Hidden Crown had all the features we were looking for, which helped it claim the best overall slot. From its natural color to the real-feel texture, these extensions impressed us right from the start. It can be tricky to find the perfect shade for redheads, but their “natural red” option looks seamless against the rest of your hair, blending in almost flawlessly. It probably helps that it’s constructed with 100 percent Remy human hair, making it difficult to distinguish where the real hair ends and where the clip-ins begin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These extensions will also hold a curl much better than your own hair, so if you are heading out to an event and expect to be out for a while, you’ll be pleased to find that these extensions will keep their style throughout the night. That being said, it does come with a bit of a learning curve where the application process is concerned. The extensions come with several clips, which you have to evenly place across your head to secure them. However, once they’re in, they held on quite securely without any slippage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Remy human hair <strong>| Shades: </strong>35<strong> | Length: </strong>8-26 inches<strong> | Number of Wefts Included:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-rpzl-human-hair-clip-in-extensions></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RPZL Clip-In Extensions</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RPZL Human Hair Clip-In Extensions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rDYtNV7OD1-vHLgCuCJHUYuHHgA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rpzl-clip-in-hair-extensions-ae2c5b5ef6ef4179a3a219acdc4dfc96.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>RPZL</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, these extensions are a splurge, but they are worth every penny. If you want instant red carpet-level glamour, mega volume, and just all around glossy, expensive-looking hair, this is it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The clip-ins are made of 100 percent virgin Remy hair, meaning that the hair has never been dyed before turning into extensions. Not only are the extensions totally pure, but they were also treated to be frizz and tangle resistant, so you can expect soft and completely undamaged hair when you shop from RPZL.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When worn, it’s completely impossible to distinguish which hair is our own and which are the extensions (although we still recommend styling your own hair in tandem with the extensions in order to create an even look across your head).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because the clips remain sturdy once fastened, it’s easy to go through with a curling iron without tugging or pulling the extensions out of place. We did however notice a mild discomfort from the clips after a full day of wear, which is to be expected if your head is not used to the sensation of having clips on them for long periods of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re ready to take them off, you have to prepare a separate case to store the hair in as the brand does not provide one for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Virgin remy hair <strong>| Shades: </strong>15<strong> | Length: </strong>16-20 inches<strong> | Number of Wefts Included:&nbsp;</strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-insert-name-here-ponytail-extensions></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Insert Name Here Ponytail Extensions</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Insert Name Here Ponytail Extensions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UwntBSJ9cT_BgH7Xg-H1H6nrDcM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/insert-name-here-shayla-clip-in-ponytail-extension-37378d13068f4c5eb88536a9c27af570.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Insert Name Here</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone looking for a quick and easy way to change up their hairstyle for a day, this wavy clip-in ponytail will help you achieve a stylish look in no time. It earned our best budget spot because you'll get a stylish 'do that is available in an impressive number of shades without compromising too much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the 21 shade options, the ponytail is super versatile and looked great on a range of hair colors and textures, including those of us with naturally straight hair. Just slick back your hair and insert the comb at the base of the ponytail, wrap the velcro around and boom, your hair is transformed without ever needing to touch a curling iron.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And despite the wavy texture, we were pleasantly surprised with how soft the extensions felt. The 26-inch ponytail definitely makes for an eye-catching statement, but along with that gorgeous length comes a bit of weight, which began to tug and feel a little heavy after some time. When you’re done using it, you can safely store it in the provided pouch to use again another time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Infinity-flex vegan hair<strong> | Shades: </strong>21 <strong>| Length: </strong>26 in <strong>| Number of Wefts Included:&nbsp;</strong>6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shade-range-luxy-hair-clip-in-extensions></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shade Range</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Luxy Hair Clip-In Extensions</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Luxy Hair Clip-In Extensions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1qQHpOV5FJ5s7mUMbevx5ZjpvJI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/luxy-hair-clip-in-extensions-b15912be22594693beeaaf5073145375.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Luxy</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With 37 shade options, it doesn't get more inclusive than this set from Luxy. The brand offers the highest number of color options out of all the winners on this list, although most land within the blonde to brown range.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested these clip-in extensions on both platinum blonde and red hair, and while the color match for the blonde extensions was nearly immaculate, the red hair showed a slight mismatch on our tester. Luckily, the brand offers a 60-day exchange and return policy, so if it’s not exactly what you’re looking for, you can swap it for something that is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, the Remy hair felt silky soft to the touch, never tangling or becoming stringy. It made the final result look extremely glamorous — it’ll definitely make you want to spend a night out on the town.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With this set you’ll get nine pieces of hair, separated into four attachments in various sizes and widths. You won’t have any trouble sectioning them into their respective spots to make the overall look smooth and consistent. Once in, the hair feels natural and weightless, letting you enjoy the look without the tugging or discomfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Remy hair<strong> | Shades: </strong>37<strong> | Length: </strong>16-24 in<strong> | Number of Wefts Included:</strong> 9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-natural-hair-onyc-kinky-3b3c-curl-7-piece-clip-in></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Natural Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ONYC Kinky 3B–3C Curl 7 Piece Clip In</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ONYC Kinky 3B&amp;ndash;3C Curl 7 Piece Clip In" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ICmTbURdt_1OVEWVFf5uRx5zudE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/onyc-tight-kinky-curl-7-piece-clip-in-bd101be4828b460cb1232dbd6345ddd9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ONYC</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As its name suggests, the Kinky 3B–3C Curl 7 Piece Clip In set was designed specifically to mimic this specific natural texture, making it the best option for those who rock their natural curls. Although our tester's hair was darker than the extensions they used, it matched her coily texture exactly. With this set, you’ll receive a generous supply of seven clip-in pieces. It mimics a 3B-3C texture, and it accentuated our tester’s natural hair perfectly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The application process is quite easy, even for beginners, which also makes it a great option for anyone new to the clip-in game. You can choose how many of the pieces you want to use, and adjust the volume of your hair according to the vibe you want. Once they’re in, the virgin kinky-curly blend of real human hair looks completely natural on the head. If you want to spice it up a bit, we found it very easy to define the curls further using mousse. You can also easily style it in dozens of different ways, courtesy of the different weft lengths. The downside here is that the style is only offered in two colors, which makes it difficult to color match.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Virgin kinky curly human hair<strong> | Shades: </strong>2<strong> | Length: </strong>12-20in<strong> | Number of Wefts Included:&nbsp;</strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-volume-bebonia-spiral-clip-in-extensions></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Volume</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bebonia Spiral Clip-In Extensions</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bebonia Spiral Clip-In Extensions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Gg6pyi1DU1B6o27GbFByVdxvQDs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bebonia-spiral-clip-in-extensions-2d39a20266b643ee836a96accfa3bf81.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bebonia</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a simple way to take your hair from ordinary to extraordinary, the trick is to add volume, and these extensions make it a snap. The Bebonia spiral curls come in a variety of different sizes, making them easy to layer around your head to amp up the fullness. Due to the tight curly texture of the set, they're especially great for 2C and 3A hair types that need a little extra boost. You can choose between two thickness options, 110 g and 220 g. The first is recommended for those with fine hair, while the latter is for those with thicker hair, as it has more hair per weft and three more wefts total.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re new to the clip-in game, then you’ll be delighted to find how easy it is to clip these in. The six wefts can be placed along your head to layer as you please, and once in, they remain comfortably on without any tugging or pulling.

There are two features in particular that make this option stand out above the rest for curly haired people: The two thickness options and the strong hold of the curl, which didn't soften or relax despite our repeated usage. And although the extensions are styled in tight ringlets, you can also soften them into a looser curl with a bit of coaxing, just coat the strands with a styling product and start brushing until you get the curl pattern you want.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, the quality of these extensions is excellent. During our testing day at The Lab, our attending hair stylist on set was even blown away with how authentic these felt. Even better, the attachment process is pretty simple — the most difficult part of the process is splitting and sectioning off your hair. For this, hair stylist D’xenia Clark recommends “using a double mirror to install ringlet curly extensions because you want your parts to be clean.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that while the hair feels luscious and sleek, if your own hair is also not soft, it may look inconsistent. The brand says that this product is for 3C to 4A hair types, but we found it to be more for 3A to 3B hair. As you work with that expectation, you’ll be quite pleased with how the product looks and feels on your head.

We curated a list of the top 21 extensions and we put 16 to the test. We paired each tester with the extensions that best matched their hair color and textures. Our testers then wore the extensions twice a week for four weeks to properly and thoroughly analyze their performance and write down their insights throughout the process. We asked the testers to specifically consider how easy the extensions were to use, wear and fasten, how comfortable they were to wear, the overall quality of the extensions, and whether the value matched the retail price. After reviewing all of the tester feedback, along with insights from two professional hairstylists, we narrowed our list to the eight best and top-performing clip-in hair extensions.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Natural vs. Synthetic Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hair extensions</a> can come in two forms: Natural human hair (called Remy hair) or synthetic. While many people prefer natural hair extensions for their authentic look and feel, along with its longer lifespan, they do usually come with a higher price tag. However, that investment provides you with the option to wash, style, and reuse your extensions as you would normal hair. They are also known to outlast their synthetic counterparts — natural hair extensions maintain their structure, shape, and overall look for about a year while synthetic hair averages only four to six months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hairstylist Dimitris Giannetos, who has styled everyone from Amal Clooney to Rosalia, recommends natural clip-ins. “You can do anything you want to them and re-create any hairstyle you love since they are made out of real human hair,” he says “when using synthetic hair you can’t use any heat which limits the hairstyles you can do.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Synthetic hair extensions are a little trickier to maintain, and despite recent innovations to make them appear like natural hair, they may never reach the same level of softness. Yet, the lower price point of synthetic hair offers you the ability to purchase more extensions and styles, giving you the freedom to rotate through various looks without the costly commitment. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Barely Extensions Ponytail</a> is made of synthetic materials, but could easily be mistaken for real hair just by its looks.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hair Color and Texture</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping online for clip-in hair extensions, it can be a tricky dance to find the perfect color and texture. That being said, don’t fret if the extensions don’t match your hair to a T. All hair types have slight variations in texture and color already, and the addition of extensions simply accentuates this feature. This is at least how Giannetos styles his clients. He uses either highlighted colors or two different colors because “all hair has a natural dimension,” meaning that the highlighted extensions “blend better with your own hair.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most brands echo this recommendation, suggesting a mix-and-match application to achieve a more natural result. However, if you do want a color and texture that matches perfectly, Priscilla Valles, hairstylist to Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Katy Perry and Hailey Bieber, recommends matching at your ends rather than your roots. “You usually want extensions for length or thickness because that is where they are usually extending from and that’s where the blending occurs,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We recommend searching through a brand that offers a wide variety of looks, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Luxy Hair Clip-In Extensions</a> or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Hidden Crown Clip-In Extensions</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weft</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair wefts refer to the number of hair strips found on the extensions.

For long-lasting clip-ins and a healthy scalp, always remove the extensions before heading off to dreamland.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer at InStyle, with two years of experience covering fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products.
