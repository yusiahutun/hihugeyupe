Scribd’s ebook catalog numbers over two million titles. But there’s lots more to this comprehensive subscription, with audiobooks, magazines, news articles, podcasts, and even sheet music included. The Scribd app is available worldwide on a wide variety of devices, including iOS, Android, and some Kindle tablets.</p><p>Scribd offers gift subscriptions for six or 12-month periods, with special offers often available.
