But beyond those two mainstays, several unique details, cuts, and designs separate basic faux leather leggings from pairs that will stand out in a crowd. We asked fashion mavens to recommend their favorites of the faux trend, and we shimmied in and out of several pairs ourselves to see what truly passed muster. (Read: We made sure you can actually get them on and off your body easily, unlike what poor Ross experienced in that one Friends episode.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-spanx-faux-leather-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Faux Leather Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Faux Leather Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YYnwZLvXqh0bL_QJjKBtmHgtjpg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-faux-leather-leggings-18d5541910754f2889d7cd28309d88c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re 2-in-1 shapewear and stylish pants.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>They run a bit small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx can do no wrong, especially with these pants made of nylon, elastane, and spandex blend. But don’t let the faux label fool you — these feel heavy like natural leather, meaning they don’t turn sheer or appear see-through. These shiny high-rise pants are compressing but also super smooth and breathable. They have typical shapewear properties — like making your backside look good — but not constricting, so you are still able to move in them. Because they are shapewear-esque, they run a bit small because they’re tighter than most. We recommend sizing up if you don’t want as much compression. Otherwise, they offer the right amount of control and functionality. Not to mention, they’re low-maintenance with washes. (Just throw ‘em in a machine on cold, and you’re ready for another wear.) They also offer short, regular, and tall sizes, checking all our boxes for the top spot on our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The faux leather finish adds a trendy texture, while Spanx's shaping technology provides a flattering fit,” says Alicia Lloyd, styling supervisor at Stitch Fix. “The leggings offer versatility for both casual and dressed-up looks, making them a wardrobe staple that accentuates the figure and boosts confidence.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-3XL <strong>| Colors: </strong>1<strong> | Texture: </strong>Smooth<strong> | Length: </strong>Regular, Petite, Tall</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-asos-new-look-faux-leather-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Asos Faux Leather Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ASOS New Look Faux Leather Leggings in Black" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bH8hJQXJnaUP2EMItghdkusNLAg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/asos-new-look-faux-leather-leggings-in-black-03646738165d4c3999b4e88aeef31b0e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ASOS&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The quality, fit, and style look more expensive than they are.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some have found these can appear see-through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a budget-friendly option that still looks expensive and feels high quality, these faux leather leggings from ASOS are your best bet.

Do note that some found these to be see-through, so we suggest pairing with black or skin-colored underwear to avoid any mishaps. We probably wouldn’t wear them to the gym, so we’re not too concerned about the squat test.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0-14<strong> | Colors: </strong>1<strong> | Texture: </strong>Smooth<strong> | Length: </strong>Regular</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-mugler-black-embossed-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mugler Black Embossed Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ssense Mugler Black Embossed Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j1af7Y7gALBtupkoJAq5FC47ay8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mugler-black-embossed-leggings-45793ec2120640309c9c5cc94831a4a1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ssense</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The futuristic embossed detailing elevates the classic legging.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The bikini bottom etching at the front can draws attention to your crotch, which might be uncomfortable for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If there was ever a case to blow half of your rent on must-have leggings, this is it,” says fashion stylist and TV personality Cindy Conroy. “Mugler’s Debossed design is futuristic yet modern and approachable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Crafted in Portugal, these faux patent leggings feature a paneled construction, a high-rise, and a logo embossed at the front and back (because if you’re gonna spend that much, you want people to know what’s up!). While we love the unique embossing detail, the bikini bottom etching on the crotch might make some more conservative wearers uncomfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Wear them with a longline blazer or crisp <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white poplin</a> and they are office-appropriate,” suggests Conroy. “Versatile enough to be worn on weekends and weekdays, they are your new wardrobe workhorse.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 24-36 | <strong>Colors</strong>: 1 | <strong>Texture</strong>: Ribbed | <strong>Length</strong>: Regular</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waist-commando-perfect-control-faux-leather-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waist</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Faux Leather Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Commando Perfect Control Faux Leather Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FJn3wByc_vQJg7gfygVJf0xgt10=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commandoWomensPerfectControlFauxLeatherLeggings-e4624a2a2b854dbdb759eb1472e607cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They aren’t see-through — even the white option is full coverage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some wish the fabric was thicker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These four-way stretch, high-waisted faux leather leggings come in eight full-coverage colors that never fade. Lifestyle Influencer and Beauty Writer Katya Bychkova appreciates that “they offer less compression, which makes them more comfortable for everyday wear,”&nbsp;she tells InStyle. “They feature a shiny, grainy texture to look more like genuine leather and could pass for skinny leather pants.” And InStyle senior commerce editor Chloe Anello swears by them, too, because they never roll down or weirdly gap at the ankles — a feat for a taller woman, like herself. They’re similar to Spanx, but according to Anello, they hold up a little better and have a more natural-looking faux leather, though they are a bit thinner than some expected. Plus, they have a much better size range.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS Petite-3X <strong>| Colors: </strong>8<strong> | Texture: </strong>Smooth<strong> | Length: </strong>Petite and Regular</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-workout-carbon38-high-rise-full-length-legging-in-takara-shine></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Workout</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Carbon38 High Rise Full-Length Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Carbon38 High Rise Full-Length Legging in Takara Shine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_Ekea9Ab9IvBwtaeAIPzwruyu70=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Carbon38-High-Rise-Full-Length-Legging-in-Takara-Shine-8711e2c9839946dba717e7b155bde647.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Carbon38</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> They look high fashion and sleek enough to wear in and out of the gym.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There are no tall or petite options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These faux leather workout leggings have a major cult following and for good reason. Not only are they sleek, elegant, and sexy, they’re made from a full coverage fabric with four-way stretch, allowing you to easily move through high-intensity workouts. The high-rise and wide waistband ensures you’re supported without feeling constricting, while the full length and glossy liquid finish feels high-end and perfect for nights out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pair with a matching sports bra for a monochromatic, off-duty model vibe during pilates, yoga, spin, or HIIT class.

Customers rave about their fit and support; they’ll keep you snatched without creating discomfort or rolling down. We don’t love that they need to be dry cleaned, which is kind of a pain for leggings. However, we love the fit and support so much, we’re willing to do a dry clean run for them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: XS-5XL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 4 | <strong>Texture</strong>: Matte | <strong>Length</strong>: Regular</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-spanx-faux-patent-leather-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Faux Patent Leather Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Faux Patent Leather Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Iq5wcXN1p94OppwbCsitYue6A5E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-faux-patent-leather-leggings-c4e646bb3a6649aaa80404055a4cc9a1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The patent leather finish adds a touch of glam to any outfit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They can squeak as you walk, and there may be color transfer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx is just so good at faux leather leggings, they had to make our list twice. With a tall inseam though sizes XS-1X, these height-inclusive leggings feature a high shine faux patent leather finish that is glamorous, bold, and ready to make a statement. Lloyd loves how these sculpt the body with their hidden core shaping technology. Plus, these hit at the natural waist for optimal coverage and are free of a center seam for a seamless fit. However, like many of Spanx’s styles, these do run a bit small, so be mindful of this when shopping. The brand does state that they will stretch and form to your body, so if you prefer a snugger fit, don’t be alarmed by the initial shimmy it takes to get these bad boys on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Do be mindful that you might be squeaking as you move around (like all patent leather). To avoid this, you can simply apply lotion or oil to the leggings’ inner thigh. Also, note that color may transfer onto other materials or surfaces, so wash with like colors and try not to have prolonged contact with light-colored clothing and surfaces, like a white purse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>PXS-T1X<strong> | Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Texture: </strong>Patent<strong> | Length: </strong>Regular, Petite, Tall</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-commando-control-top-faux-patent-leather-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Control Top Faux Patent Leather Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Commando Control Top Faux Patent Leather Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rriu44v6S5pmCgWya6g6O1g_wkw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Commando-Control-Top-Faux-Patent-Leather-Leggings-fa52db710f2c45879d850b48508ee6cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes in six patent faux leather colors for a bold, high-shine ensemble.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Only 1X -3X have a side seam for shaping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not every legging is offered in petite sizes, so we love how Commando makes these in a petite inseam from XS to XL.

Whether you work out in them or go out in them, they have you covered in all directions. Styling tip: Snag the midnight blue colorway for a fun deviation from classic black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-3X<strong> | Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Texture: </strong>Smooth <strong>| Length: </strong>Regular</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-range-wilfred-free-daria-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color Range</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wilfred Free Daria Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aritzia Wilfred Free Daria Pant High-waisted Vegan Leather leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YBKtUMtd0MkqjQxBgIgJbDz3GRQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Wilfred-Free-Daria-Pants-729ed195a51a4cd582691cb70739f236.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They are size and height-inclusive with nine gorgeous colors to choose from.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They run super small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re the type of shopper that finds a beloved garment and buys them in every color, today’s your lucky day.

You can style them any way you feel like. “The styling possibilities are endless,” says celebrity stylist and costume designer Ebony Brown. Her favorite is a faux leather trouser styled with a cropped top and an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>oversized blazer</a>, à la workwear casual. But if you’re looking for something edgier, Brown says go for a ‘90s vintage t-shirt and faux leather joggers. “This is a cute street style moment for my clients, usually paired with high-heeled boots or sneakers, depending on the mood,” says Brown. Faux leather leggings worn with a pair of stylish <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rain boots</a> can even elevate your rainy-day fashion.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What shoes look best with faux leather leggings?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As always, wear what makes you comfortable, but if you’re looking for an editor-approved look or a stylist’s recommendation, the experts think that faux leather leggings look their best with boots. “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tall boots</a> and platform boots can elevate the look,” says Brown. But for something more casual, a sleek pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>white sneakers</a> will do the trick.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you wash faux leather leggings?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’re lucky: Vegan and faux leather are much easier to clean than genuine leather. Removal of stains can be done with warm water and a microfiber cloth. As for a full scrub down, you may want to check if your pleather pieces are machine washed. Most pieces don’t come with the drab of dry-cleaning; Some can be thrown right into the washing machine on cold. For pairs that can’t, hand scrub in cool water with a gentle cleanser until no suds remain. Turn inside out and repeat. Ensure no excessive detergent is left, as this can cause it to stiffen and crack.
