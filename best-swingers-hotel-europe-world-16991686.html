Something like a nudist cruise or hotel probably hasn’t crossed your mind – but would you take it one step further?
Swingers resorts are becoming more and more popular and there are now many resorts around the world where you can participate in group sex."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

La Mirage Swingers, Gran Canaria, Spain</p><p>La Mirage consists of 32 individual bungalows – some with connecting doors – a swimming pool, two whirl pools, pool bar and various game rooms for couples.</p><p>As one TripAdvisor reviewer said, “The two play rooms were good, the larger one was particularly nice with it’s large round bed, massage table and mirrored ceiling. Much fun was had in there.”</p><p>2. Hotel Oz’Inn, France</p><p>This hotel is located just a few minutes away from the entrance of naturist holiday camp Cap d'Agde.</p><p>The hotel includes a couples lounge, rainfall showers and themed evenings.</p><p>3. Paradise Hotel, Blackpool, UK</p><p>Blackpool’s Paradise Hotel is currently owned by Sue and Keith Locke who have said the hotel is for “swingers” and “liberated adults”.</p><p>Sue said the hotel has a wide range of guests ranging from solicitors to police officers and they are fully booked nearly every week.</p><p>“We even had an ex-chief constable come to stay with his partner and recently we had a disabled lady visit us,” Sue said. “She had an absolute ball and slept with seven men in one night.”</p><p>4. Villa Atraides, Corfu, Greece</p><p>If you’re more into soft swinging – where couples participate in sexual acts in the same room as each other but don’t actually swap sexual partners – then this is the place for you.</p><p>Located on the idyllic island of Corfu, Greece this boutique hotel has four bedrooms and is clothing optional.</p><p>5. The Toren, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p><p>While not explicitly advertised as a swingers hotel, the Toren has been described by a visitor as “a gateway to uninhibited nudity, sex, culture, museums, more sex and amazing dance clubs.”</p><p>The hotel itself is housed in two buildings that date back to the 17th century and boasts views of the Keizersgracht canal – they also have whirlpools in select rooms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKSfq7Juv8SxZpudo6l6tMPIp56eqqNitbDAxKVknq2ipL2medaoqaWcXWaDeoWQb29v</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
