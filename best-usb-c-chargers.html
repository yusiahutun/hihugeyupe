When you connect a charger to a smartphone, both devices negotiate a power transfer which varies in amperage and voltage. Most chargers can deliver one to six combinations—multiplying amperage and voltage equals wattage. For example, if a charger uses 5V at 3A, it's pushing 15W. If it's using 15V at 3A, that's 45W to your device.</p><p>When picking a charger for a device, you just need to know the maximum voltage and amperage it can use. If you grab a charger from Amazon that maxes out at 5V and 3A, it may not even charge your device. If it does work, it will deliver power at below the maximum wattage, meaning more slowly.</p><h3>Q: What's the difference between USB-A and USB-C?</h3><p>USB-C is quickly replacing USB-A because it's an improvement in a few areas. USB-C is more compact than USB-A, and is capable of charging devices and transferring data at much higher rates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>Q: Why is Apple changing to USB-C charging?</h3><p>Apple is changing to USB-C charging because of a European Union law that requires cell phone manufacturers to switch to universal USB-C chargers by 2024. While the change is significant, Lightning and USB-C themselves aren't all that different—both are completely reversible connectors capable of high-speed data transfer and quick charging.</p><h3>Q: Are all USB-C chargers the same?</h3><p>Not all USB-C chargers are the same. Modern USB-C chargers use GaN chips, while older chargers use silicon chips. Newer USB-C chargers are safer to use and less likely to overheat, and frequently offer features like fast charging or support for data transfer. USB-C chargers also come in a variety of wattages, ranging from a 140W rating suitable for high-power laptops to a convenient 10W for charging mobile accessories.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiZnqukYsK0roycZJygkae0pr7SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
