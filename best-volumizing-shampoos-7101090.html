Volumizing shampoos do the dirty work (literally), cleansing the scalp of pore-clogging oils, pesky product build-up, and other junk that can weigh down precious strands. They also work overtime, providing hair with hydration, moisture, and a glossy finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, finding the right shampoo is no easy feat.

It’s no surprise, therefore, that the Full Shampoo instantly became one of our go-to's as well. This lightweight shampoo effectively cleanses the scalp and seamlessly breaks down buildup from our occasionally excessive use of dry shampoo (guilty, but we bet you are too).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from giving hair that just-washed feeling for up to four days (!), this shampoo also adds a full body effect, an extremely difficult feat for fine hair. The key ingredient in this product is amaranth, which plumps individual hair strands and thickens fibers for instant volume. Plus, it's made with phytantriol, which preserves hair color and helps reduce damage from hot styling tools. Essentially, this product offers the benefits of a shampoo, volumizing mousse, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>heat protectant</a> in one. And who could forget the gloss factor? Not us, nor our silky, shiny hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Proprietary amino cleansing complex, amaranth peptides, phyantriol<strong> </strong>|<strong> Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scent: </strong>Floral<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>8 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loral-paris-everpure-volume-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oréal Paris EverPure Volume Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Or&amp;eacute;al Paris EverPure Volume Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pGlEESgan79-z7MHEU8CnDrxnjg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loreal-everpure-volume-shampoo-b33b8d5c325947d5bbd035a807de3054.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This shampoo is made with white lotus flower, which gently cleanses and amps up the bounce factor.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The scent is uniquely floral, making it smell very perfume-like (it takes a certain type of nose to appreciate it).<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">L’Oréal Paris continuously delivers salon-worthy results for a fraction of the cost. And though they have a variety of volumizing and thickening shampoos, the EverPure Volume Shampoo easily outperforms the rest to give limp and lackluster hair life again. Made with an innovative blend of lotus botanicals, it provides lasting volume, luminous shine, and impressive color protection — all without the inclusion of sulfates and parabens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from providing effortless volume and manageability, this shampoo also cleanses the scalp without stripping it of its natural oils for under $10. Because of the white lotus in the formula, this shampoo smells uniquely floral, which won’t be pleasing to every nose. So if you tend to avoid floral fragrances, you probably won’t like this either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Lotus botanicals, rosemary leaf oil<strong> </strong>|<strong> Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scent: </strong>White lotus<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>8.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-redken-volume-injection-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Redken Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=720 data-sizes=750px alt="Redken Volume Injection Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/X02EnV17ItqLp0yZoe4mgsY-4-k=/fit-in/1500x720/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Redken-946651a65d6c4884a96a4adf3d1ae36b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> At 10.1 ounces, there is a lot of product in the bottle.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While it officially is scentless, some have noticed a fine and delightful scent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you get extensions, or did you just use the Redken Volume Injection Shampoo… that’s the question you’ll be answering once you start using this product. As the name suggests, the shampoo truly injects volume like it’s a filler for hair. From flat and lifeless to uplifted and bouncy, it’s as though this shampoo completely transforms what frames your face.</p><p>And let’s not forget — with the lift in volume comes a lift in confidence. If you’ve tried but failed with other, more affordable products, it’s time to give this a try as it’s not going to let you or your hair down. Although the bottle claims to be scentless, we should warn that there is a very faint and delightful smell to the formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Filloxane, silicone polymers |<strong> Sulfate-Free: </strong>No<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scent: </strong>No<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>10.1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-krastase-densifique-bain-densit-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kérastase Densifique Bain Densité Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="K&amp;eacute;rastase Densifique Bain Densit&amp;eacute; Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KFtUXNUVujbhOjV21FUrrfYvJ38=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kerastase-Densifique-Bain-Densite-Shampoo-de384002b9fd45ceafc005d46f791a7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This shampoo is made with hyaluronic acid, which helps to strengthen and visibly thicken hair while also preventing future breakage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This shampoo is not hydrating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Kerastase Densifique Shampoo is great for those with thinner hair who want to add volume and shine,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Helen Reavey</a>, a board-certified trichologist and celebrity hairstylist (whose clients include Harry Styles, Amal Clooney, and Marisa Tomei). “It’s formulated with hyaluronic acid, gluco peptide, and ceramides, which work to prevent breakage, promote elasticity, and hydrate, while also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>strengthening the hair</a> and adding volume.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of making hair look and feel fuller, it gives hair, roots, and scalp a thorough wash, removing heavy buildup that can weigh down strands – the kiss of death for volume.

The 100 percent vegan and cruelty-free formula is not just healthy for all hair types, but safe for color-treated heads as well. It taps the powers of plant-based phytoactives (which are like nutrients for growth) and Karmatin, the brand’s proprietary vegan alternative to keratin and silicone, to enrich the scalp. And those who have tried confirmed that their hair looked visibly denser, longer, and bouncier after at least 90 days of consistent use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vegamour’s proprietary vegan silk protein, red clover, mung bean<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>|<strong> Scent: </strong>Citrus<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>8 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-color-treated-hair-pureology-pure-volume-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Color-Treated Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hFsh2xGYqSqssD2X0EEe1lCBz7M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pureology-pure-volume-shampoo-1428b1074bdc465e81fead2b2393af36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It softens the hair by pumping moisture back into the strands.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not fragrance-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair that’s frequently been colored may look dry and flat after some time. This type of hair needs some extra TLC, which is why we recommend this sulfate-free and vegan volume shampoo from Pureology. Like all shampoo for color-treated hair, this shampoo protects your color while pumping some much-needed moisture into the strands. It works to bring life back into your hair and help make the color look as natural as possible. When you run your fingers through, you’ll notice how much softer your hair feels as well. And while it doesn’t necessarily thicken the strands, it does make your hair feel light and airy again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Eucalyptus leaf extract, orange peel extract, wheat and vegetable proteins<strong> </strong>|<strong> Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scent: </strong>Zesty citrus | <strong>Size: </strong>9 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-hair-virtue-full-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Damaged Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Virtue Full Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Virtue Full Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ze5jQWIK9uWVpPxw5pHcmmqS8TU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Virtue-Full-Shampoo-8bcdcc0bc976489598b83f997df7093d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Virtue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can tame frizzy flyaways on top of adding volume.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The scent is a little strong.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re noticing more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>split ends</a> than usual or your strands have taken on a brittle, straw-like quality, you may need to kick your hair care routine into damage control.

"This promotes overall scalp health," says Olivia, which is exactly what this option from Virtue does.</p><p>Not only does it add volume, but it works to thicken the hair strands as well. As a little bonus, it tames frizzy hair as well, should you be sporting this type of hair. It’s not scentless, however, and while some love it, others, Kratky included, are not the biggest fans. If you’re sensitive to strong scents, you’ll want to skip this option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Virtue’s proprietary keratin protein blend, phospholipids, pink pomelo, artichoke leaf, glycerin<strong> </strong>|<strong> Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes | <strong>Scent: </strong>Fresh citrus<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>8 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-hair-odele-volumizing-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Odele Volumizing Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Odele Volumizing Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6NmJVBMKEei2-S6h_mFJI3wLkI4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/odele-volumizing-shampoo-59873abc4d4d43d69dddaa70d4c70fab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It doesn’t use any harsh chemicals, gently removing excess oils without harming the scalp.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 100 percent natural scent is gender-neutral, which is a hate-it or love-it for people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Oily hair can look flat from all that extra weight holding down the strands. To combat this, you want a shampoo that can thoroughly cleanse without stripping the hair dry (natural oils are good for you, after all). This option from Odele was specifically formulated with oil-prone scalps in mind. The sustainable label is cruelty and sulfate-free, using only clean ingredients that are gentle on the scalp. Without any harsh chemicals, the excess oils get washed away and leave the roots feeling fresh and bouncy again.

Your scalp needs to remain nice and clean for optimal scalp health.<p>“Usually, when someone is looking to add volume, it’s because their hair is fine or thinning,” explains Reavey. “To combat this, so many people pile on the products to add shine, lock in moisture, and grow the hair. However, too much product buildup can damage the scalp, ultimately stunting hair growth and overall health. I’d recommend being cognizant of how often you use volumizing shampoos’ based on if your scalp is dry or oily.”</p></li><li readability=14><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: When it comes to hair care products in general, it’s important to know what’s in them as well as what’s not in them. “I recommend steering clear of formulations that are full of sulfates and silicones, which are often used to smooth the hair and lock in moisture, however, over time they can build up on the hair and weigh it down, leading to less volume,” explains Reavey.<p>“Similarly, parabens, phthalates, and artificial fragrances typically can dry the hair out, leading to an increased risk of hair thinning and fallout.” Instead, look for products that list glucose, glycerin, or betaine as they can be beneficial in adding healthy volume.&nbsp;“Volumizing shampoos are typically formulated with lightweight ingredients, such as hydrating amino acids, that aim to not weigh the hair and roots down, but still provide moisture and shine,” says Reavey. “I think it is vital to understand that any product that provides volume and texture can easily dry the hair over time,” warns Valcin.<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the difference between volumizing and thickening shampoo?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Volumizing shampoo works to plump up the roots and lift them up, creating the look of a bouncy and full hair. “Most of the volumizing shampoos create the illusion of thickness by temporarily plumping up the roots and strands of hair, eliminating hair gaps,” explains Viola.</p><p>Thickening shampoo works to increase the diameter of the hair strand itself, making it stronger and less likely to fall out. It should be noted, however, that thicker hair tends to be heavier and can weigh down at the roots, making it look like less volume. It’s important to know therefore what results you are seeking when shopping for volumizing or thickening shampoo.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you use volumizing shampoo every day?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because volumizing products can dry out hair, it’s important to use them sparingly. “To avoid dryness, it’s best to shampoo the hair twice or a maximum of three times a week, especially when using a volumizing shampoo,” says Valcin. If your hair is extremely dry, you can try using a moisturizing hair mask, a hydrating hair serum, or a deep conditioner to give it the moisture boost it needs after using a volumizing shampoo. Those with oily hair on the other hand can get away with washing their hair more frequently.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is volumizing shampoo bad for hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To keep hair from drying out, Valcin recommends alternating the shampoo you use. “Volumizing shampoo is not bad for your hair as long as it is not the only type of shampoo being used,” he says. “Most volumizing shampoos contain some type of alcohol which over time causes each hair strand to lose its strength and can lead to breakage. It is critical to have other shampoos to alternate with.
