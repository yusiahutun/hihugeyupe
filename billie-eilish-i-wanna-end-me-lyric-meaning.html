Naturally, the pressure was on.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/billie-eilish-what-was-i-made-for-lyrics.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/billie-eilish-grammys-2024.jpg><p>“I don’t want to be too dark, but I genuinely didn’t think I would make it to 17,” Eilish said. She just turned 18 in December, yet the artist confesses to contemplating suicide while on tour in the past. “I think about this one time I was in Berlin and I was alone in my hotel. And I remember there was a window right there,” she added. “I remember crying because I was thinking about how the way that I was going to die was. I was going to do it.”</p><p>Eilish continued, explaining that these moments were referenced in “Bury a Friend” with the lyrics: “Today, I’m thinkin’ about the things that are deadly, the way I’m drinkin’ you down / Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me.”</p><p>Thankfully, the young Los Angelino is recovering. And she wants fans of hers to experience the same stability, telling Gayle that she’d do anything to protect those struggling with their mental health. “I just grab them by the shoulders and I’m like, ‘Please take care of yourself and be good to yourself and be nice to yourself,'” she said. “Don’t take that extra step and hurt yourself further.'”</p><p>If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>National&nbsp;Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>.
