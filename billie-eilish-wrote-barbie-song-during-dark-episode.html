Billie began, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Hollywood Reporter.</strong></a></p><p>"I think we all feel like that occasionally, but I think if somebody like me, with the amount of privilege that I have and the incredible things that I get to do and be and how I have really not wanted to be here -- sorry to be dark, damn -- but I've spent a lot of time feeling that way," she continued. "I just want to say to anyone that feels that way, be patient with yourself and know that it is, I think, worth it all. I think that it's good to be alive now. I didn't feel like that for a very long time."</p><p>"Especially when we were asked to write this song, I was in a dark episode, I guess, and things didn't make sense, like, life. I just didn't understand what the point was and why you would keep going," Billie added. "[I was] questioning everything in the world."</p><p>Billie recalled the moment when she and Finneas were shown footage from the film by director Greta Gerwig.</p><p>"I was sitting there next to Finneas, it was just the two of us in this theater, basically," she said. "I was just watching Barbie, Barbie, say and feel things that I really, really, really resonated with and felt so close to. I felt so seen, and I did not expect that.</p><p>"I think that this movie is the most incredible, most empowering, and beautiful, and funny, and just unbelievable piece of art in the world, and I'm so so honored to be a part of it," Billie added, before passing the microphone over to her brother, who spoke about their upbringing and expressed his gratitude toward their parents.</p><p>"What Was I Made For" has already received a handful of awards nominations, including &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Golden Globe</strong></a> and Critics' Choice Awards nominations for Best Original Song. The track also picked up a whopping five <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Grammy </strong></a>nods, including Record of the Year and Song of Year. Billie and Finneas are predicted to be nominated for Best Original Song at the 2024 Academy Awards as well.</p><p>This isn't the first time Billie and Finneas have received recognition and accolades for a song recorded on a movie soundtrack. The duo previously swept the 2021/2022 awards season for "No Time to Die" from the James Bond movie of the same time, winning an Oscar, Golden Globe, Critics' Choice Award, and a Grammy for the song.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or has had thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life, <strong>get help</strong>.
