Gilbert writes all of his own songs, so 'Bottoms Up' doesn't feel fake or cliche despite being thematically similar to many bro-country songs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tailgates, Daisy Dukes, Bonnie and Clyde and parties beneath the moonlight are all elements of popular songs from 2013, but the 28-year-old's unique delivery adds a fresh coat of paint.</p><p>Most importantly, Gilbert avoids any gratuitous "Uh-Uh" or Yeah-yeah" grunts.</p><p>"See you and me ridin' like Bonnie and Clyde / Goin' 95 burnin' down 129 / Yeah, lookin' for the law while I push my luck," he sings to begin this guitar-heavy song. As usual, his delivery is a sort of melodic narration. A heavy instrumental introduction seems to foreshadow some sort of sonic explosion, but the track never becomes reckless. Gilbert keeps it cool. Even the guitar solo fits into his soundscape.</p><p>"Throwin' on down, rock this quiet little country town yeah / Drop a tailgate on your truck / Find a keg and fill your cup / Kick it on back, pretty little mama lookin' at you like that / Make you wanna slide on in like girl what's up / Tonight it's bottoms up," he adds during each chorus.</p><p>Gilbert's four singles from the deluxe version of 'Halfway to Heaven' provided more lyrical depth than his first from the new album (expected in 2014), but sometimes, a good chill country-rock song that doesn't make you think is what's needed. Songs that rip your heart out or fire you up to fight are bound to be plentiful on the project, as Gilbert truly shows all his scars.</p><p><strong>Why Fans Will Love It</strong>: It's been a really long time since Gilbert released new music. 'Halfway to Heaven' was re-release of an album he cut for Average Joes Entertainment. This song shows growth while staying true to his core values and sound.</p><p><strong>Key Lyrics</strong>: "Kick it on back, pretty little mama lookin' at you like that / Make you wanna slide on in like girl what's up / Tonight it's bottoms up."</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>: Brantley Gilbert says he's a daredevil who will try anything he's dared to do. But he does have four fears: "Snakes, sharks, deep water and commitment," he told ToC in a <a href=#>revealing interview</a> earlier this year.</p><p><strong>Listen to Brantley Gilbert, 'Bottoms Up'</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qRo8GtsdhmnqKkkpq%2FtXnBqKutp52oera8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
