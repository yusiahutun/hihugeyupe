The SFO said it offered no evidence against Dahdaleh, having concluded there was no realistic prospect of conviction.

Outside court, Dahdaleh's lawyer Neil O'May said it was an emotional day for the 70-year-old businessman, who was "overwhelmed and relieved" by the not guilty verdicts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dahdaleh admitted making payments to Alba managers, but pleaded not guilty, citing "principal's consent", a defence available under Britain's Prevention of Corruption Act 1906.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: US$67m bribery trial of billionaire collapses</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2aAeIOYamhomqKewaq%2Fx2aZq6GSmr%2B6ecKaqp5lkZyuqrrSrWSboZyhtrC6wKKpnmWmnrC1u9Fmm5qglJa5prSMnKalpJGlwKa%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
