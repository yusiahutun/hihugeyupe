Britney and K-Fed, who met at a club in Hollywood in 2004 and started dating soon after, were married from 2004 to 2007. Their divorce—which came a year before Britney was placed under a conservatorship by her father, Jamie Spears—was finalized in July 2007, with Britney and K-Fed agreeing to joint custody of Sean Preston and Jayden James. In September 2019, K-Fed and Britney changed their <a href=# rel=noopener>custody agreement</a> from 50/50 to 70/30, with 70 percent to Kevin and 30 percent to Britney. K-Fed’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, explained to People in 2021 why Britney and her ex-husband have an unequal custody agreement.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ben-affleck-britney-spears-kiss.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/britney-spears-1.jpg><p>“The best thing would be for their mom to be healthy and happy. And if either of those things aren’t true, it doesn’t provide for the best setting for custody to be exercised,” Kaplan said. K-Fed’s lawyer did, however, note that K-Fed is open to a change in custody once Britney’s conservatorship ends. “If [the conservatorship is] no longer necessary, that’s great too. Just want to make sure that all of the considerations, how she’s doing are taken into account if she seeks to change the custody order in the post-conservatorship era, if that ever comes.”</p><p>A source told Us Weekly in March 2021 that <a href=# rel=noopener>Britney sees her sons “less”</a> now that their custody agreement changed. “She used to have more time with them until Kevin altered their custody arrangement after the incident with, Jamie. Since then, the boys’ visits have been less frequent,” the source said. “They spend most of their time at their dad’s house and have very few visits with their mom, especially overnight ones…They are teenagers now and want to be with their friends, not their parents. It’s nothing against Britney; they love and idolize her, and Kevin trusts her. It’s just that they’re getting older, so when they’re not at their main home with Kevin, they’re usually out doing things with friends.” The insider also claimed Britney sees her sons “periodically” and they don’t have a “set schedule.” Despite this, the source noted that Sean Preston and Jayden are “normal boys” who “just want to see their mom happy.”</p><p>So what do <a href=# id=auto-tag_britney-spears data-tag=britney-spears>Britney Spears</a>‘ kids look like now?
