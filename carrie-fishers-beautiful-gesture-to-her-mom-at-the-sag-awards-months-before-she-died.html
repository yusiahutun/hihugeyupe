Carrie starred with Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill in the Star Wars franchise. Despite their respective success, the mother-daughter duo died within days of each other eight years ago.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-carrie-fisher-gives-debbie-reynolds-lifetime-achievement-award>Carrie Fisher gives Debbie Reynolds Lifetime Achievement Award</h2><p>In January 2015, Carrie Fisher presented her mom, Debbie Reynolds, with the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award. The accolade is given to actors for the “finest ideals of the acting profession.” It is awarded by SAG, (Screen Actors Guild). The Guild is a trade union that represents people in the business of TV and film.</p><p>After being presented with the award by her daughter, 82-year-old Debbie said in her acceptance speech: “God gave us talent, so we’re very fortunate,” she said.</p><p>“My favorite <a href=#>movie</a> was&nbsp;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&nbsp;… In that film, I got to sing a wonderful song called ‘I Ain’t Down Yet.’ Well, I ain’t. Thank you all so much for this wonderful award.”</p><p>Carrie, who was then 58, paid tribute to her mom at the <a href=#>awards show</a> saying: “Not only was my grandmother her mother, she is the grandmother to my alleged daughter. It also turns out that we’re neighbors.</p><p>“[Reynolds] has been more than a mother to me, not much, but definitely more. She’s been an unsolicited stylist, interior decorator, and marriage counselor. Admittedly, I found it difficult to share my mother with her adoring fans, who treated her like she was part of their family. She has led two lives, public and private, sometimes concurrently, sometimes not.”</p><p>The <a href=#>TV</a> star added jokingly: “Four-and-half million of that money is allocated just for me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-two-die-just-a-day-apart>The two die just a day apart</h2><p>Months after Carrie Fisher presented Debbie Reynolds with the award, the two died just a day apart. Carrie passed away at the age of 60 on December 27 while Debbie died at 84 on December 28.</p><p>Carrie had been on a flight from London back to Los Angeles on December 23 when she suffered a heart attack. She had just completed filming for the latest Star Wars installment, Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi.</p><p>Unfortunately, she did not survive the heart attack and died four days later.</p><p>In a statement, a spokesperson for her daughter Billie Lourd, then 24, said: “It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning. She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly. Our entire family thanks you for your thoughts and prayers.”</p><p>Debbie took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a> to share her thanks for people’s love and support.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> penned: “Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter. I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carrie’s Mother.”</p><p>A day later, Debbie herself passed away at 84 years old.</p><p>Her son Todd said: “The last thing she said this morning was that she was very, very sad about losing Carrie and that she would like to be with her again. Fifteen minutes later she suffered a severe stroke.</p><p>“The only thing we’re taking solace in is that what she wanted to do was take care of her daughter, which is what she did best.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eAcK%2FAq6minV2btrS0xKuqZpqVlsK1tcWuo2aflajBtr7EZquoZZiav265zqZkmqxdqbWmedKanmaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMpqanrJioeqOxxaipnmWjnbJusMiem2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
