Charity Lawson, one of them, her ABC bio states that she hopes to one day relocate to Disney World. Although she doesn’t provide any other details, it makes it reasonable. Why wouldn’t you want to live in a magical area if Disney World is “the most magical place on Earth”?</p><p>While waiting for Disney World to become her permanent residence, Charity appears determined to create her own enchantment for everyone in her life. According to her biography, she is “very passionate about helping people live their best life” and has a “smile that lights up a room.” The most important thing, according to Zach, is to find someone who is “very sensitive and kind to everyone that they are around,” and Charity certainly fits that bill.</p><p>Joe Amabile,&nbsp;<a href=#>who recently married Serena Pitt,</a>&nbsp;told&nbsp;Click Bait with Bachelor Nation&nbsp;that she’s one to watch this season. “I think Charity is going to be in Zach’s top four,” he said.&nbsp;“When I saw the teaser for the season, I felt like she was having a conversation where she seemed to be the rational, reasonable person and those people usually go far.”</p><p>Reality Steve didn’t have much information on Charity’s time on The Bachelor, so he only gave a few secrets about Zach’s season. He disclosed that Charity goes on multiple group dates and at least one singles date. Additionally, we are aware that Charity goes all the way to the dates with Zach in his hometown. She isn’t named as one of the women who advance to Zach’s final three, thus it appears that Zach removes her after their hometown date. The alleged hometown date was captured on camera on November 4, 2022.</p><p>Charity is reportedly the first of the four to be eliminated from the show at the eighth Rose Ceremony after Hometown Dates. The other three moved to the next round were Gabriella “Gabi” Elnicki, Ariel Frenkel, and Kaitlyn “Kaity” Biggar.</p><h3><strong>Charity Lawson Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>Charity Lawson’s past dating life and her relationship after the show are under wrap.
