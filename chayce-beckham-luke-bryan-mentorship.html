"I appreciate him so much. It’s an open door, pretty much. Anything I need, I can call him. If I need advice or help with something or I just wanna go fish, I can call him up."</p><p>Beckham shares that many of these fishing trips with Bryan take place at the singer's "private spot" at his house, an experience Beckham still can't quite believe and one he calls a "blessing."</p><p>"I couldn’t even tell you how many times I’ve been [to Luke Bryan’s house]," Beckham says. "How many people can say they get to do that kind of stuff? I was a blue-collar worker, a normal dude down the street, and now I get to fish in Luke Bryan’s private spot when I want to. It’s a huge blessing."</p><p>The Idol winner, who released his Doin' It Right EP on April 15, says Bryan's entire family and crew also welcomed him with open arms.</p><p>"Him and his family and everyone who works for him have been good to me and made me feel like family," he states. "It’s been great and I’m lucky to have that relationship."</p><p>Bryan isn't the only artist that has welcomed Beckham into the country music family. <a href=#>Dierks Bentley</a> also went fishing with the new country star earlier this month.</p><p>"Good little adventure today," Bentley wrote alongside a photo of the two singers holding up their fish. "@chaycebeckhammusic fish game is strong."</p><p>Beckham also collaborates with country singer <a href=#>Lindsay Ell</a> on a song called <a href=#>"Can't Do Without Me,"</a> which appears on his new EP. He <a href=#>returned</a> to the American Idol stage on April 17 for a performance of the project's title track.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country 'American Idol' Stars Who Disappeared</h2><p>We cheered for them. We voted for them. We followed them. Then, these seven American Idol stars vanished. Or, at least it seems like it.</p><p>What happened to some of country music's best American Idol contestants over the last 20 years?
