One Chicago posted photos from the moment on Instagram, and fans had plenty to say. "They were always endgame," one replied, followed by a crying emoji.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d3ccc5eff5dc-natalie-and-owen-chicago-med.jpg><p id=eqORYvwqkZB data-wc=19>"Ahhh my heart!!!!

To be able to come back and give that to not just the viewers that love the show so much and really rooted for these characters, but also to give it to me and Nick, who really wanted this ending for our characters was really so beautiful. He's like a brother to me, so to be able to come back and support him in this way was just so much fun."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/198b4a0f6507-gettyimages-1031050886.jpg><p id=eOBhNSx9nxn data-wc=56>Nick Gehlfuss has also spoken about the romantic conclusion, as well as his reasons for leaving the show. "Well, it was a difficult decision, but I felt, maybe like a few months ago, that I was getting to the point of taking Dr Halstead as far as I could go with him," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>TV Line</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=ex3asj_W0I2 data-wc=25>While his time on the show has come to an end, Nick couldn't be happier with Will's ending, which ​​he agrees "makes so much sense."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/f53bd1621fae-will-and-natalie-embrace-chicago-med.jpg><p id=eUGWMxMcHE_ data-wc=67>Speaking to<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Deadline,</a> he explained: "I think that the relationship has come full circle but of course, it wasn't the only reason Will decided to leave Med. I think Will had been seeking elements of Natalie in every relationship; I don't think he ever really got over her. It was really so great to see Torrey, too. She called me to let me know she was coming."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9cab3490d7b0-torrey-devitto-nick-gehlfuss.jpg><p id=ehECC09QBQe data-wc=38>Nick added: "We fell right back into our work rhythm as if we hadn't had any time off. It was a beautiful moment at the end of the episode that I hope brings some closure to the fans."&nbsp;</p><p id=eo2oZM2Rh5Q data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcGxwZGd8pLTInJigp12isqV5xZqlrGWjnbykt8SdZK2noqeyunnDnq2irKSkerOx066pp6tdlsBuusCtmKWhlWK6orrNoqWgZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
