Keep reading...</p><h2 id=lower-the-quality-settings-to-stop-your-chromecast-stuttering>2. Lower the Quality Settings to Stop Your Chromecast Stuttering</h2><p>Quality settings are often the main performance issue when streaming video through your Chromecast. While a powerful little device, it can only stream as fast as your network connection allows.</p><p>When you stream <a href=#>4K or Ultra HD video</a>, especially from the internet, your device uses network bandwidth. Data is downloaded as a stream and routed to the Chromecast. Higher quality video means more data; as a result, Chromecast stutters are more likely.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The answer is to lower the quality of your stream. Different streaming platforms have different methods of adjusting playback quality. For example, to lower YouTube mobile's quality:</p><li>Open the app on your mobile</li><li>Select a video</li><li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon (a cog)</li><li>Tap <strong>Quality</strong> to display a list of quality options</li><li>Choose a quality more suited to your setup, or select <strong>Auto</strong> to let the app decide</li>3 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mo-smart-home-chromecast-streaming-youtube-settings1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mo-smart-home-chromecast-streaming-youtube-settings2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mo-smart-home-chromecast-streaming-youtube-settings3.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>With a suitable quality selected, tap on the Chromecast icon and stream to your TV.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=stream-local-videos-to-improve-chromecast-streaming>3. Stream Local Videos to Improve Chromecast Streaming</h2><p>When you stream a file from the internet, your hardware downloads the data as it is viewed. Combine that with streaming on a Chromecast, and you're putting a choke hold on your streaming capacity. This could be why your Chromecast keeps buffering.</p><p>For poor internet connections, this two-step process can render internet access unusable. That's why it is much more convenient to <a href=#>cast local media to Chromecast</a>.</p><p>There are several methods of streaming your content to a Chromecast. Since they've become so popular over the recent years, it's easy to find software compatible with the Chromecast by default.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Our favorite option is <a href=#>VLC</a>. Streaming to Chromecast using this versatile, free, and open-source media software is easy. Simply open VLC on your computer and navigate to <strong>Playback > Renderer</strong>.</p><p>The default option (your PC) is listed as <strong>&lt;Local></strong>. Active Chromecast devices will appear below this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/muo-entertainment-chromecast-buffering-vlc.png><p>Choose the appropriate Chromecast to stream the current video.</p><h2 id=fix-chromecast-buffering-with-an-ethernet-adapter>4. Fix Chromecast Buffering With an Ethernet Adapter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/muo-entertainment-chromecast-buffering-adapter.jpg><p>Ethernet is faster than wireless internet. But if you have an older Chromecast, there is no Ethernet port. Two options are available to overcome this. The first is an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Ethernet adapter for Chromecast</a>. This is ideal for Chromecast 1.0 and 2.0 models.</p><p>If you own a Chromecast Ultra, you should have noticed that there is an Ethernet port in the power adapter. All you need to do to enable faster internet on a Chromecast Ultra is run an Ethernet cable from your router to the power adapter.</p><p>This will afford the fastest network speeds available, potentially in any room in your home. A wired connection is far superior to wireless, so try this to solve Google Chromecast buffering problems.</p><p>Our guide on <a href=#>how to set up a Google Chromecast Ultra</a> demonstrates this in more detail.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=reduce-chromecast-lag-by-using-supported-apps>5. Reduce Chromecast Lag by Using Supported Apps</h2><p>Chromecast-supported applications provide a better-quality stream than unofficial or unsupported apps.</p><p>Luckily, most major streaming services now support Chromecast viewing. Although various unofficial applications allow users to stream content to your Chromecast, official apps are best. They typically offer the highest quality and smoothest stream possible.</p><p>For example, Chromecast lag and picture quality issues can be overcome by using the cast feature in YouTube's official app rather than third-party alternatives.</p><h2 id=change-wi-fi-channels-to-fix-choppy-chromecast-streams>6. Change Wi-Fi Channels to Fix Choppy Chromecast Streams</h2><p>One of the simplest ways to improve network speed is to change Wi-Fi channels on your router. This can help to alleviate poor quality, constantly buffering Chromecast streams.</p><p>Your Wi-Fi router broadcasts across various channels. These can become bogged down over time by multiple connections.</p><p>To learn more about this, use an analysis tool like WiFi Analyzer. This free utility from the Microsoft Store will help identify Wi-Fi problems on Windows.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=#>WiFi Analyzer</a> (Free)</p><p>After installation, use the program as follows:</p><li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and type <strong>wifi</strong></li><li>Choose <strong>WiFi Analyzer</strong></li><li>Wait while the program detects your network</li><li>Click on the <strong>Analyze</strong> tab</li><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mo-smart-home-chromecast-streaming-wifi-analyzer-windows.jpg><p>The resulting graph displays the strength of the individual channels on your Wi-Fi network and their data usage. Use this information to pick a channel with the least active connection. This will be less cluttered and will therefore provide better performance.</p><p>Sometimes the graph is difficult to read. In this case, click <strong>Recommendation</strong>. This rates each individual channel from one to 10, helping you to pick the least cluttered channel to connect to.</p><p>With a channel selected, check your router documentation for the administration screen's IP address (if you don't already know it). You'll also find the default password there, and you should <a href=#>change your router passwordchange your router password</a> for security purposes.</p><p>Enter the IP address into your web browser address bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Sign in to the router, then find the option to select a different wireless channel.</p><p>Set the wireless channel recommended in WiFi Analyzer and save the change. Not only should you notice a better Chromecast connection, but a generally faster internet connection all-round.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=just-wait-chromecast-buffering-isn-39-t-your-problem>7. Just Wait: Chromecast Buffering Isn't Your Problem</h2><p>If you've got to this point and still nothing has changed, consider an alternative: the problem isn't with your Chromecast.</p><p>After all, the internet is—as its name tells us—a vast interconnected network of networks. While hardware and software work together to optimize performance, there is always scope for issues. Network traffic, for example, can slow down streams (one of many <a href=#>reasons for using a VPN</a>), as can server issues.</p><p>Chromecast buffering might be occurring with the Eurosport player, the Twitch app, the MLB TV app, whatever. If their servers are struggling, or there is network traffic, there is little that you can do except wait.</p><p>Eventually, the problem will sort itself out.</p><h2 id=fix-those-stuttering-chromecast-streams>Fix Those Stuttering Chromecast Streams</h2><p>The Chromecast lets you convert a standard TV into a smart TV. Yet, those of us with substandard internet connections may still suffer from buffering issues. To fix these, you can:</p><ul><li>Close other apps</li><li>Lower video streaming quality settings</li><li>Stream local videos only</li><li>Use a Chromecast Ethernet adapter</li><li>Stick to Chromecast-supported apps</li><li>Switch Wi-Fi channels on your home network</li><li>Wait while remote services and networks resolve their performance issues</li></ul><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>By following these steps, any Chromecast buffering and streaming issues should be resolved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fmLWwvM%2ByZJygoqS6pq%2FArKtmq6SnsqK50mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
