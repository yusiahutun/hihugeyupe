Chrissy Teigen is opening up about her breast augmentation surgery on their 10th anniversary, revealing she would have had them removed if not for COVID-19 quarantine.
On Monday, the model shared a throwback photo of her -- and her girls -- rocking the runway in a lacy, white bikini. &#34;Happy 10 year anniversary to these titties and RIP to these teeth,&#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Teigen said she wanted to get her implants removed, but can't because she's self-isolating amid the global coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>"@whitneycummings yes dude and I really want them OUT," the "Cravings" author replied. "Quarantine would have been perfect time but apparently it's not 'ESSENTIAL' smh."</p><p>Many more stars took to the comments section to share their thoughts on Teigen's fun post.</p><p>After <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> commented with laughing emojis, the mother of two replied, "@kimkardashian you guys were at this show!!! It's why I was listed as 'model walks runway' no one cares about me bahahahahah."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I love you," wrote <a href=#><strong>"Real Housewives of New Jersey"</strong></a> star <a href=#><strong>Melisa Gorga</strong></a>. "GOD BLESS," model <a href=#><strong>Tess Holliday</strong></a> wrote.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> also replied with emojis.</p><p>Teigen's post came just weeks after she opened up about her breast implants in an interview with <a href=#><strong>Glamour UK</strong></a> earlier this month.</p><p>"Yeah, I did my boobs when I was about 20 years old," she recalled, explaining her decision to undergo the surgery. "It was more of a swimsuit thing. I thought, if I'm going to be posing, laid on my back, I want them to be perky. But then you have babies and they fill up with milk and deflate and now I am screwed."</p><p>Though she had the surgery, the "Lip Sync Battle" host said she didn't go up a cup size. "I just filled them out, so they are rounder and firmer," she said. "I had a quarter 'teardrop' cup in the bottom and filled out the breast line."</p><p>While she wants her implants removed, after having kids -- she shares Luna, 3, and Miles, 1, with husband <a href=#><strong>John Legend</strong></a> -- she's hesitant about another surgery.</p><p>"I want them out now. If I could do one thing, it would be to have a lift," she explained. "I think you're supposed to replace [implants] every ten years. But when you have kids you think about [the risks] of surgery and I think, 'This is not the way I want to die, in boob surgery.'"</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
