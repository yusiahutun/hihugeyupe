Second time’s a charm,” said <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chrissy Teigen </strong></a>in the Instagram clip she posted on Jan. 4. In the shot, Chrissy, 35, looks into the camera at an angle that focuses on her nostril. Sure enough, there’s a piece of jewelry there. Chrissy seemed very satisfied with the piercing, and she tagged <strong>Brian Keith Thompson</strong> (of the world-famous <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@bodyelectrictattoo</a>) in the post. Considering the disaster that she had the first time she got her nose pierced, Chrissy decided not to mess around with this second attempt.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“So I did this today, and it immediately fell out and healed the second she left because she did it wrong lmao,” Chrissy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> on Dec. 28. In the shot, she showed off her nose piercing, the skin around the jewelry slightly red. “Like how do you do it wrong? It’s a hole, through the nose. It’s like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong></a>‘s bobsledding joke. It’s impossible to do wrong,” she added, before correcting herself. “Wait, actually, it was the luge.” As for her nose, it seemed that Piercing/Tattoo Twitter got all up in Chrissy’s mentions. “It’s out and healed. You don’t have to keep being a–holes. Thanks, I’ll do it better next time for you. I promise!! U sweet little angels never cease to surprise me.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s out and healed you don’t have to keep being assholes thanks I’ll do it better next time for you I promise!!

On that day, she also shared a video of her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>peeling apples</a>. “cinnamon rolling into the new year lol sober new year is l i t.” At the end of 2020, Chrissy revealed that she had a month of sobriety under her belt, and she shared why she made the huge decision <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to stop drinking</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chrissy-Teigen-nose-ring-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>“One month ago, on my birthday, I got this book from my doctor and friend,” said Chrissy. The book, Quit Like A Woman by <strong>Holly Whitaker</strong>, was an eye-opener for Teigen. “I was done with making an a– of myself in front of people (I’m still embarrassed), tired of day drinking and feeling like sh-t by 6, not being able to sleep. I have been sober ever since, and even if you can’t see yourself doing it or just plain don’t want to, it’s still an incredible read.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49tZpygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjerSxwqilnWWepMCmec%2BinKubmaO0bsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
