From parabens, phthalates, and sulfates to oxybenzone, triclosan, hydroquinone, and artificial fragrances, these dirty beauty words are fear inducing enough to elicit a Marie Kondo-style purge of your entire bathroom cabinet, even in the most apathetic among us. But what does clean beauty even mean? Can you trust all-natural labels? And are nontoxic products important?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nearly 50 percent of women are already using clean beauty products, according to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/health/a28377998/real-beauty-survey/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper’s BAZAAR poll" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Harper’s BAZAAR poll</a> of more than 1,000 women across all ages, races, and ethnicities, and more than 60 percent of women would be willing to splurge on one. But with more options than ever before—you don’t need to stray far from the drugstore to find a natural version of your favorite skin care, makeup, and hair care products—there comes more opportunity for greenwashing. Not only is the beauty industry self-regulated (meaning anyone can make a “clean beauty” claim with no oversight), but America’s cosmetic regulations for safe products is 81 years old—older than most modern beauty companies. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no authority to recall toxic beauty products unless a manufacturer volunteers. And while the European Union has banned more than 1,000 chemicals common in personal care products, the United States has banned just 11. Should you be concerned? And where do you even start on a path to a cleaner beauty routine?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To separate science from science fiction, we spoke with leading beauty experts; pored over studies and data; and swiped, swatched, and spritzed hundreds of clean hair and skin care products to get to the root of what it really means to be clean and natural in the realm of beauty.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Clean Beauty 101</h2><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Where Do I Start?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We believe in taking a common sense approach to clean beauty: If a product is intended to stay on your skin all day (like a moisturizer) and/or it’s covering a large surface area (like body lotion), then you should try to switch to a cleaner alternative.

Below, the most common beauty ingredients of concern and the reasons why they’re so notorious.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Parabens</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Parabens are a group of preservatives and antimicrobial chemicals that prevent the growth of nasty things like bad bacteria and mold in your beauty products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The problem:</strong> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720718301060?via%3Dihub data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studies confirm" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Studies confirm</u></a> that parabens mimic estrogen in the human body, with evidence linking them to reproductive organ harm, thyroid disruption, hormone-related cancers, and obesity. Exposure to parabens through beauty products was recently linked to early onset puberty in girls, according to a study published in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/34/1/109/5204432?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Human Reproduction" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Human Reproduction</u></a>. They’re also easily absorbed: Pregnant women who used more personal care products had a greater amount of parabens in their urine, according to a 2014 study published in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/147/4/443.xml data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Reproduction class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Reproduction</u></a>.

Fragrances are considered a trade secret and, therefore, do not have to be disclosed. On a related note, phthalates, which help fragrances last longer, are a group of chemicals used to keep materials and products (nail polishes, hair sprays, plastics) pliable. You’ll find them on an ingredient list abbreviated as DEP, BBzP, DBP, and DEHP.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The problem: </strong>Where there is the vague ingredient fragrance, there are phthalates—most of the time, anyway.

Fragrance on its own can also be a trigger for allergies and asthma attacks, since we don’t know exactly what ingredients are being used in both short- and long-term exposure. Cosmetics giants Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson have all committed to fragrance transparency in the last several years.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.hearstapps.com/loop/2019-harpersbazaar-cleanbeauty-header-v2-graded-v3-1565036696.mp4/poster.jpg alt="Image no longer available" title="Image no longer available" width=100% height=auto decoding=async fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Ethoxylated Agents</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ethoxylated agents include polyethylene glycols (PEGs), ceteareths, oleth, and sulfates. Sulfates are responsible for the bubbles and lather in cleansers like shampoo. Some sulfates are synthetic, while others are derived from sulfur and petroleum, as well as natural sources like coconut and palm oils. PEG compounds are used as thickeners, solvents, and softeners in hair products, as well as some moisturizers and base products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The problem: </strong>Sodium lauryl sulfate is a harsh cleanser, which is why it gets a bad reputation in the world of hair care. It will strip your hair, but it’s not inherently toxic. To save your hair, sodium lauryl sulfate is sometimes converted into sodium laureth sulfate through a process called ethoxylation. A by-product of this process is 1,4-dioxane, a chemical the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-03/documents/ffrro_factsheet_contaminant_14-dioxane_january2014_final.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</u></a> lists as a likely human carcinogen.

Definitions are subjective and often change from company to company, package to package, making it nearly impossible to navigate—or decipher—the truth from greenwashing. Here, we break down the most common buzzwords for some much-needed clarity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong>WHAT DOES CLEAN MEAN?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Safe for people and the planet, clean means that a beauty product should have considered human and environmental health, using a nontoxic element as a baseline and plant-based ingredients for active results. Much like eating clean rejects the idea of processed foods and focuses on nourishing, plant-based produce that delivers all the vitamins and antioxidants needed for a healthy immune and digestive system, the same is true for clean skin care.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong>WHAT DOES GREEN MEAN?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The word green should mean that the product does no harm to the environment. For instance, a reef-safe sunscreen with biodegradable packaging would be labeled green. However, this is a wishy-washy term with no true definition and is usually used as an umbrella for any product that claims to protect the planet’s resources.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong>WHAT DOES ORGANIC MEAN?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Personal care products that are certified to be at least 95 percent organic will bear an official USDA Organic Seal. Products bearing the USDA Organic Seal must also comply with handling and manufacturing specifications, and the use of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Can%20GMOs%20be%20Used.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="genetically modified organisms" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>genetically modified organisms</u></a> is prohibited. In an effort to avoid pesticides, the clean beauty industry has begun to use organic, plant-based ingredients in products wherever possible. However, the certification is expensive, so many smaller brands will independently label ingredients that are organic on packaging, despite not carrying an official seal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong>WHAT DOES NONTOXIC MEAN?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Water and oxygen can be toxic in the wrong dose. So when a beauty product is labeled nontoxic, it likely means that the ingredients have not been shown to cause adverse health effects at the levels found inside the formula and for the intended use. This is true of every beauty product currently sold in the United States. In the clean beauty space, nontoxic means that a product shouldn’t include any ingredient that’s been deemed toxic at any dose by a third-party resource like the European Union or Environmental Working Group.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong>WHAT DOES SUSTAINABLE MEAN?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sustainable goes hand in hand with green. It means that the ingredients on the inside of the package—including how those ingredients were sourced—and the packaging itself should not be harmful to the planet. When you use any product, the ingredients go down the drain and into the water system, which, thanks to exfoliating microbeads and preservatives like BHA, is causing a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/4/2/11/pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="marine environment health crisis" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>marine environment health crisis</u></a>. Likewise, many conventional beauty products are made from petroleum jelly and are packaged in plastic, both created from the oil industry. Truly sustainable ingredients are those that are ethically sourced and proven to be safe for the environment, with sustainable or no-waste packaging being defined as glass packaging, biodegradable packaging, post-consumer recycled packaging, or the ability to recycle empty bottles appropriately through a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TerraCycle class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>TerraCycle</u></a> program.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong>WHAT DOES VEGAN MEAN?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A beauty product is vegan if it doesn’t contain any animal by-products or ingredients sourced from animals. Common non-vegan ingredients found in clean beauty products include beeswax, honey, lanolin, and tallow. Many people associate vegan with clean, but this is not the case. A product can be vegan and still contain chemical ingredients of concern.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong>WHAT DOES CRUELTY-FREE MEAN?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A beauty product is cruelty-free if it has not been tested on animals anywhere along the manufacturing line or before being sold. It can also mean that any animal-derived ingredients were not extracted at the expense of an animal’s welfare (like natural-fiber makeup brushes). A beauty product can be cruelty-free but not vegan, and vice versa.</p><img alt="White, Green, Leaf, Plant, Grass, Botany, Flower, Terrestrial plant, Illustration, Flowering plant, " title="White, Green, Leaf, Plant, Grass, Botany, Flower, Terrestrial plant, Illustration, Flowering plant, " width=1080 height=279 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/divider3-1565292664.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=61 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Natural Doesn't Always Mean Better</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For you or the environment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Essential oils are extremely potent plant compounds, often used as pharmaceutical-grade natural remedies, and they are not regulated by the FDA.

But aesthetician Kristina Holey says it’s also imperative to look at the processing and sourcing of natural ingredients to ensure that they will be received by the body without a negative impact.

But it’s important that any synthetic ingredient is being formulated by people who are knowledgeable in quality control and the whole chain of sourcing, she says, “to really ensure that whatever is going into your product is healthy. And if there are synthetics used in a product, they need to have a purpose for the skin.” (Rather than act as fillers, stabilizers, or preservatives.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aesthetician <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://studiobritta.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Britta Plug" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Britta Plug</a> adds that when it comes to the efficacy of all-natural products, it’s also important to know when the ingredients were bottled. An expiry date of six to 18 months after opening is something to strive for when shopping for natural products. “Even if something is natural, oftentimes it's made with ingredients that have been sitting on the shelf for years—like, actual years,” Plug explains. “[It could be made from] dried herbs that have been hanging out in a lab and no longer have that nutrient density.” Translation: It won’t actually work.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.hearstapps.com/loop/fda2-1565363185.mp4/poster.jpg alt="Image no longer available" title="Image no longer available" width=100% height=auto decoding=async fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 data-node-id=71 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Consider the Environmental Impact of "Natural"</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=72 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The perils of palm oil is a great example. Palm oil, used in everything from lipstick to shampoo, is a natural ingredient that comes from the fruit on tropical palm trees. However, producing palm oil wreaks havoc on the environment.

And it's important to note, she adds, that the alternatives for plant-based ingredients are usually petroleum-based products—which is the “core of so much conventional beauty … and is not good on any level.”</p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img alt="clean beauty guide" title="clean beauty guide" width=1080 height=273 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mainarticlenext-1565030045.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Photographed by Daniel Thomas Smith | Styling by Aya Kanai | Hair by Luke Chamberlain | Makeup by Chiao-Li | Manicurist, Geraldine Holford | Modeled by Nissa Pouncey and Babette Strijbos | Video DP, Lauren Paige McCall | Video Producer, Isabel Montes | Video Editor & Colorist, Erica Dillman | Executive Editorial Director, Joyann King | Chief Visual Content Director, Alix Campbell | Design Director, Perri Tomkiewicz | Designer, Ingrid Frahm<span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Olivia Fleming is the <a href=#>Features Director</a> at HarpersBAZAAR.com, and Jenna Rosenstein is the <a href=#>Beauty Director</a> at HarpersBAZAAR.com. Two years ago, Olivia and Jenna started casually sharing links with each other about clean beauty. What started out as a hobby (from disecting the lastest research to discovering the most innovative new products) quickly became an obession. But they soon realized that the business of clean beauty was as confusing as it was compelling, thanks to a lot of confliciting data and obscure marketing jargon. To separate science from science fiction, Jenna and Olivia spoke with leading beauty experts; pored over studies and data; and swiped, swatched, and spritzed hundreds of clean hair and skincare products to get to the root of what it really means to be clean and natural in the realm of beauty.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3RnmaaamhognOBlGxmnKSVlrtursSarK2xXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
