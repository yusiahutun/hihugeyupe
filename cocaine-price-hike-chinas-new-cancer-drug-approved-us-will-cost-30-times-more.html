Its US wholesale price will be US$25,200 for the same amount of medication, according to a Takeda prescribing document, putting it at 24 times the cost in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Drug companies in the US have claimed the high cost of research and development is behind the price of drugs in the country, however a study published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association challenged this idea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The US has the highest prices for new drugs in the world, but the country’s federal health insurance agency historically has had no ability to negotiate these prices, according to the study.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The authors found that of the 60 drugs they studied – representing one-fifth of all drugs approved in their study time period of 2009 to 2018 – there was no association between estimated research costs and the drugs’ listed price.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Drug companies charge what the market will bear,” the researchers said. This is influenced by demand for the drug, whether patients need to continuously take it, and existing market competition.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese scientists develop early screening method for pancreatic cancer</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Toripalimab was approved, there was speculation the drug could be priced at a significant discount compared with its main competitor on the US market. This stemmed from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly promising that the Chinese PD-1 inhibitor they were seeking FDA approval for would come at a 40 per cent discount if approved.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But during an investor call after Toripalimab received approval, Dennis Lanfear, the chief executive of Coherus, said such a “heavily” reduced price was off the table, according to FiercePharma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Keytruda, New Jersey-based Merck & Co’s main counterpart to Toripalimab, is also sold in China and its list price on entering the market was half its price in the US, according to FiercePharma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fruquintinib is an oral medication approved to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, the first chemotherapy-free treatment option approved for patients with all types of the cancer in over a decade. It first received approval by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Colorectal cancer – which begins in the colon or rectum – is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of cancer related deaths for both men and women in the US, according to the American Cancer Society. Worldwide, colorectal cancer was the third most prevalent type, Takeda said in a press release on the medication.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For more than a decade there has been limited innovation for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,” said Teresa Bitetti, president of global oncology business at Takeda.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Colorectal cancer accounts for 7.8 per cent of all new cancer cases diagnosed in the US, and 70 per cent of patients with the cancer will experience metastasis – when cancerous growths spread beyond the colon and rectum – according to Takeda.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Metastatic cancer patients often present with inoperable disease … we must evaluate and consider treatment options that will improve overall survival without compromising quality of life,” Cathy Eng, a doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, said in a HutchMed press release.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The approval of Fruquintinib is based on two trials with more than 1,000 patients. During the trials, those who received the medication with supportive care had double the amount of progression-free survival compared to those who received a placebo and supportive care.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Patients receiving Fruquintinib had their risk of death cut by 34 per cent, according to Takeda. The most common side-effect of the medication was hypertension, followed by hand-foot syndrome and elevated protein in the urine, according to the FDA.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/06/26/clean-thumb_3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:23</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">US charges Chinese manufacturers for alleged fentanyl ingredient trafficking in landmark case</p><p>US charges Chinese manufacturers for alleged fentanyl ingredient trafficking in landmark case</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the three Chinese drugs approved by the FDA this month, rights to market the product in the US belong to other companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Takeda will manufacture and commercialise Fruquintinib outside China, HutchMed will receive royalties on net sales, and could receive other payouts if major milestones are hit by the drug, HutchMed said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Efbemalenograstim alfa – which will be marketed as Ryzneuta in the US by New Jersey-based Acrotech Biopharma – will help prevent the side-effects associated with low neutrophil levels, according to the company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having low neutrophil levels increases a patient’s risk of infection, and chemotherapy-induced low levels often happen in the weeks after treatment, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Western drug makers pivot to India as China becomes ‘less attractive option’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The drug, which was approved by China’s NMPA in May, has undergone 12 clinical trials involving more than 1,200 patients across the world, and found to be effective in cutting the time patients experience severe low neutrophil levels, Acrotech said.</p>Wang Xiaodong, co-founder of biotechnology firm BeiGene, said on the sidelines of the Hong Kong Laureate Forum this month that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China would drive a boom</span></a> in the research of innovative medicines.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China has already caught up [with the West].
