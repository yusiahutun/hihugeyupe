That means more Americans can't afford basic needs like food, clothing, shelter, and utilities than has been the case in more than a decade.</p><p>But the situation isn't just affecting Americans living in poverty. United Way uses the term ALICE to refer to the increasing number of people who are asset-limited, income-constrained, and employed but are still not able to afford their basic needs. In 2021, 13% of Americans earned below the federal poverty level but many more, 29%, fell under the ALICE umbrella, according to the grassroots movement <a href=#>United for ALICE</a>.</p><p>A study published in August 2022 from Brandeis University found that more than 75% of low-income families working full-time cannot cover the cost of basic needs. What's more, fewer than 1 in 5 low-income Hispanic and Black families in particular are able to afford the costs of a household budget. "Full-time work alone <a href=#>isn't enough to cover the everyday essentials</a> most families need to support themselves," the study's lead author, Pamela Joshi, who holds a doctorate in social policy, said in a statement.</p><p>If you're looking for ways to help, particularly as the temperatures drop and the holidays approach, consider cleaning out your closet and donating a coat to those in need. To help point you in the right direction, <a href=#>Stacker</a> compiled a list of coat drives near Hattiesburg using data from <a href=#>One Warm Coat</a>, a nonprofit that provides free coats to children and adults in need across America. Since 1992, they've given out more than 7.85 million coats.</p><p>"This is one very small way to take a step forward and do something very tangible," One Warm Coat CEO Beth Amodio <a href=#>told USA Today</a> in October 2023. "It's impossible to change the world. But it is possible to change one person's experience, one person at a time."</p><p>Read on to find out where you can contribute.</p><p><strong>Lily Baptist Church</strong></p><p>- Address: 358 Kennedy Street, Mobile, Al 36603</p><p><strong>Waterfront Rescue Mission- Mobile Campus</strong></p><p>- Address: 279A N Washington Ave, Mobile, AL 36633</p><p><strong>Always Knowing the Truth</strong></p><p>- Address: 1810 Highway 80 W, Jackson, MS 39204</p><p><strong>Stewpot Community Service</strong></p><p>- Address: 1100 W Capitol St, Jackson, MS 39203</p><p><strong>Banfi Wines at Republic National Distributing Company Mississippi</strong></p><p>- Address: 104 Lone Wolf Drive, Madison, MS 39110</p><p><strong>Esther's Haven House</strong></p><p>- Address: 2112 Iberville Street, New Orleans, LA 70112</p><p><strong>J.Crew Shops at Canal Place #775</strong></p><p>- Address: 333 Canal Street Suite 124, New Orleans, LA, 70130</p><p><strong>JOBCORPS of New Orleans</strong></p><p>- Address: 8825 Airline Highway, New Orleans, LA 70118</p><p><strong>FINRA</strong></p><p>- Address: 1100 Poydras Street, Suite 850, New Orleans, LA 70163</p><p><strong>Banfi Wines at Republic National Distributing Company New Orleans</strong></p><p>- Address: 809 Jefferson Highway, New Orleans, LA 70121</p><p><strong>Banfi Wines at RNDC New Orleans</strong></p><p>- Address: 809 Jefferson Highway, New Orleans, LA 70121</p><p><strong>Hearts of Compassion Ministry</strong></p><p>- Address: 413 W Cedar St, Durant, MS 39063</p><p><strong>United Purposes</strong></p><p>- Address: 406 Prairie Ave, Eutaw, AL 35462</p><p><strong>Waterfront Rescue Mission-Pensacola Campus</strong></p><p>- Address: 380 W Herman St, Pensacola, FL 32505</p><p><strong>Black Girls Rock of MS, Inc.</strong></p><p>- Address: 224 Ms Highway 182, Starkville, MS 39759</p><p>This story features data reporting by Karim Noorani, writing by Jaimie Etkin, and is part of a series utilizing data automation across 395 metros.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/analytics.stacker.com/tracking/900fbb0e-5aae-4eae-89f6-fd9feb132642/pixel.gif?source=feed" height=1 width=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwv9Oaq55nk6SutXnDq6CvnaNiu6at0WafmqyknrK0rtSrnmibn6G5pq%2FToqanl5WasHJ9lZqaZnCRbK9ugZWbmWZwlWV%2FbrKRn5ienJVohHGuj2efraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
