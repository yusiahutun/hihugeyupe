Wynonna earned three consecutive No. 1 hits with “She Is His Only Need,” “I Saw The Light,” and “No One Else On Earth.” A musical force, Wynonna followed her wildly successful debut with the multi-platinum disc, Tell Me Why, which produced several hit singles, including “Tell Me Why,” “Is It Over Yet,” “Rock Bottom,” and “Girls With Guitars.”</p><p>“Getting to share this tour with the fans who have been with me for 40 years means the world to me. Deep diving into my first two solo albums, “Wynonna” and “Tell Me Why,” track by track, will be a trip down memory lane. As I sit and listen to these two records, I’m flooded with the memories that surrounded that time in my life. The fans held me up and supported me through that season of change in 1992, and I now see “herstory” repeating itself. This music healed me then and is healing me now. The circle of life continues,” Wynonna said.</p><p>Fan Club pre-sale tickets will be available on August 22, and general on-sale is available starting August 25.<br>The tour will also offer various VIP packages and experiences for fans to take their concert experience to the next level. Packages vary but include premium tickets, commemorative laminate & concert tickets, and a specially designed Wynonna cocktail set via VIP Nation.</p><p><span><strong>Back To Wy Tour Dates:</strong></span><br>October 26, 2023 Indianapolis, IN Murat Theatre at Old National Centre<br>October 27, 2023 Ames, IA Stephens Auditorium<br>October 28, 2023 Prior Lake, MN Mystic Lake Casino*<br>November 2, 2023 Rosemont, IL Rosemont Theatre<br>November 3, 2023 Bowler, WI North Star Mohican Casino*<br>November 4, 2023 Peoria, IL Peoria Civic Center Theater<br>November 9, 2023 San Antonio, TX Tobin Center for the Performing Arts*<br>November 11, 2023 Oklahoma City, OK The Criterion<br>November 12, 2023 Austin, TX ACL Live at Moody Theatre<br>November 17, 2023 Birmingham, AL Alabama Theatre<br>November 18, 2023 Bossier City, LA Margaritaville Casino*<br>November 19, 2023 Dallas, TX Majestic Theatre<br>November 25, 2023 Louisville, KY Palace Theatre<br>November 30, 2023 Durham, NC Durham Performing Arts Center<br>December 1, 2023 Knoxville, TN Tennessee Theatre</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJdoaWpnk6TCr8DRsmSmraOesLR51rKlqKaelnqrwcOdZJqmnqTCr6%2FErGSbmZOgerW7jLCwZqyfqr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
