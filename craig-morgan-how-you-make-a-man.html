It was 17 years ago, and his gut instinct led to the biggest hit of his career.</p><p>The new song is a moving vocal showcase that describes embracing life's trials and tribulations because they make you a better human being.</p><p>"In our society, people are scared to fall in love because they're afraid they'll get heart broke,"&nbsp;Morgan tells Taste of Country Nights. "Those scars that you have, that tissue is stronger than the tissue beside it and it's strong because it got hurt."</p><p>Megan Conner, Michael Walton and Skip Black wrote "How You Make a Man." Morgan's longtime producer Phil O'Donnell pitched it to him.</p><p>"I just, immediately — the very first listen — called him," Morgan shares. "I wasn't even finished with the song. I called him and said, 'Let 'em know I'm cuttin' it.'"</p><p>Such&nbsp;immediate passion for a song he didn't write has only happened once in Morgan's career: He recalls feeling very confident about 2005's "Redneck Yacht Club" immediately. "How You Make a Man" just suits&nbsp;him, and&nbsp;kicked&nbsp;off a new project</p><p>"I have two prerequisites when I'm singing and writing. One, I have to be able to sing it and make it believable. And two it has to be something radio could play. Doesn't mean they will, and I respect that ... I feel it's important to do those two things, and when you do, you leave everyone else no choice."</p><p>Find "How You Make a Man" on the upcoming deluxe version of the God, Family, Country album on Nov. 11.
