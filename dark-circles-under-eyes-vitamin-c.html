"A few of them include periorbital veins underneath the eyes that can have a dark blue to an almost dark purple hue that gives the appearance of under-eye circles. Hyperpigmentation as a result of either an inflammatory condition (such as eczema), seasonal allergies, or even a reaction to certain skincare products can lead to dark circles. Shallow tear troughs as a result of the loss of collagen and volume that gives the skin support can also be a cause of under-eye circles. And sometimes herniated fat pads which result in bags underneath the eyes — aka 'eye bags' — can also result in the appearance of under-eye dark circles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Woo! Well, here's the good news: if your dark circles are caused by hyperpigmentation, then vitamin C can do the trick. But even if it's not, there are still other solutions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We spoke with both Dr. Davis and NYC-based celebrity esthetician, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Vanessa Marc</a> to find out more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-vitamin-c-help-to-treat-dark-under-eye-circles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does Vitamin C Help to Treat Dark Under-Eye Circles?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As an antioxidant, it helps to protect the skin from oxidative damage and free radicals that are floating around in the air that result in aging, wrinkling, and hyperpigmentation of our skin," Dr. Davis shares. "Vitamin C decreases the production of melanin by inhibiting tyrosinase, which is an enzyme that results in the production of melanin and pigment in the skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, of course, there's a bit of a catch. Marc notes that while vitamin C is very effective when it comes to brightening skin and diminishing some dark spots, it can be a very difficult ingredient to work with, and if not formulated properly, it loses efficacy over time. That's why she's a fan of Murad's Vita-C Eyes Dark Circle Corrector.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$62; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's formulated with gold stabilized vitamin C, delivering a more powerful dosage of vitamin C to ensure the stability and potency of vitamin C in skin," she explains. "It's also formulated with red and brown algae extracts, which help to target puffiness and discoloration such as blue, purple, brown, and red under eyes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The product includes light-reflecting particles that help to instantly brighten the area as well.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-other-ingredients-can-help-diminish-the-look-of-dark-under-eye-circles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Other Ingredients Can Help Diminish the Look of Dark Under-Eye Circles?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Davis, the notion that eye creams are some sort of sick joke is a myth. The key to seeing results, she says, is all about being consistent — for at least a few months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I look for an eye cream I look for one that is extremely hydrating because the skin underneath the eye is very sensitive and needs to be hydrated as much as possible," she shares. "One of my favorites is Alastin's Restorative Eye Treatment that contains mimosa tree extract that reduces upper eyelid sagging, niacinamide, and green tea leaf extract that helps to prevent and diminish dark circles."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$85; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>alastin.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The MD is also a fan of SkinCeuticals' A.G.E. Eye Complex, which contains blueberry extract and peptides. Both ingredients can help improve not only the appearance for dark circles, but also wrinkles, puffiness, and creepy skin under the eye, she explains.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop:</strong> $98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>dermstore.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"However with any skin care product I always explain that consistency is key and nothing happens overnight," Dr. Davis adds. "So I would give a product at least a three-month trial period before saying if it does or does not work."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Properly Color Correct</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-else-can-you-get-rid-of-dark-under-eye-circles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Else Can You Get Rid of Dark Under-Eye Circles?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First off, you want to book an appointment (whether in-person or virtually) with your dermatologist. From there, your derm will be able to figure out the root cause of the darkening in the area. Then they can come up with an appropriate treatment plan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If the patient has periorbital veins then usually I recommend specific laser treatments to help treat the veins safely and reduce the under eye dark circle appearance," Dr. Davis says. PicoSure and RevLite are examples. "If a patient has hollow tear troughs, what happens is light can hit the area differently around the eyes resulting in shadows that give the appearance of under-eye circles. Hyaluronic acid fillers, such as Restalyne, are a great and safe option to help restore volume that has been lost."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are also more invasive options available. "If a patient has herniated fat pads then usually I will perform a lower eyelid blepharoplasty," the derm explains. "This will remove the herniated fat pads and smooth out the skin to help improve the appearance of the under-eye area."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLGivspmmqKqk6GytHnUp5ueql2axqa%2FjK%2BgrZmdnrturw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
