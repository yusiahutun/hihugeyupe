Vajda House is just one example of what are known as next-generation boarding houses, offering modern amenities, private bedrooms and a shared kitchen and bathroom.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“What is happening with a lot of boarding houses is they are closing and being renovated and then being reopened. Their prices are significantly higher than they were before the renovation,” she said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“If you go into Vajda House now it’s beautiful, it’s absolutely transformed.

I can’t afford the rent any more.'Elaine Macnish, Newtown Neighbourhood Centre<p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In response, her team faced an “internal dilemma” by raising its longtime upper threshold of “low cost” from $250 to $350 a week. Even with the adjustment, this week’s list contains just 22 entries.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“If we say, ‘Look this is affordable’, and it’s nearly 70% of a state pensioner’s income, is this the right thing to do? It can’t be sustainable,” she said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The inner west and city centre have the highest density of boarding houses in Sydney. While privately run boarding house room rates are not capped and are subject to – and advertised on – the open market, an additional layer of vulnerability comes from the limited rights of boarders in boarding houses, who are not protected by the Residential Tenancy Act, she said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The property at 117 Probert Street is registered as a General Registrable Boarding House with the NSW Accommodation Register. Once registered as a boarding house, there are significant barriers to reversing the registration and converting the building for other uses.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Macnish’s team has seen a rise in inquiries from those who are turning to accommodation support services for the first time, many of whom are over the age of 70.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Not everybody is eligible to access emergency accommodation. [Boarding houses] are quite hard to get, especially for single males. We are seeing an increase in homelessness because those options are becoming more and more limited.</p><figure id=c843cfe9-8ec6-48b1-b5e3-f274b5bc233b data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>‘How do you live?’ Australia’s rental crisis is pricing low-income workers out of a homeRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“We have people every week turn up here and say, ‘I don’t have anywhere to go. I can’t afford the rent any more.’”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Cathy Callaghan, senior policy officer at Shelter, welcomed new NSW housing regulations that stipulate new boarding houses must be affordable and run by community housing providers, but they do not apply to boarding houses that predate the 2021 legislation.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The State Environmental Planning Policy (Housing) serves to protect the most vulnerable renters, but Callaghan does not believe it will encourage many new providers.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>And, while rental prices rise unfettered, she said “it’s crazy to expect the private market is going to properly look after those people”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The effect is a large and growing category of homeless people who are living in severely overcrowded buildings.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“You might have 12 students living in a 2.5 bed unit. They sleep in shifts. It’s not secure. It’s not long term and they are in housing stress,” she said. Low income earners who spend more than 30% of their income on rent are deemed to be in housing stress.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In Newtown, advocates for affordable housing remain caught between competing demands.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“We often think what can we do to help this?” said Macnish. “Because it is the private market, there is very little we can do. And if you’re an investor, and you’ve just invested several million dollars in renovating, you need to make it work financially.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>For Byrne, who once lived in a Balmain boarding house, that reality leaves the most vulnerable members of his community with a choice between two bad options.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“It’s a disgrace that in Sydney in 2023 the choice for low-income people is moving out of the suburb that is their home or living in substandard conditions,” he said. “We should be able to do a lot better than that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJmlqMGzrcuimGamlazAcH6Pa2poq5WlfHF%2Fjp2grJmjqb%2BwwdJmo6ivXZ67pLvMnmStnZ6Wu7W%2FjKmpopuVmXqwwdNmpp9lnprErcWMq5ynp6aWwaawjJummqqUnruoeceorKydow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
