Her big break came with </span><i><span>Family</span></i><span> in 1976 and led to several more iconic roles in the two decades that followed. The two-time Emmy winner revealed that she was <a href=#>retiring from acting</a> in 2001.</span></p><p><span>“A lot of people have wondered what I’ve been up to,” she said in a statement at the time. “I retired from my career after 24 years. My feeling was that it was time to play my biggest part — myself! I must say that it has been the best thing that ever happened to me. So many fans are disappointed that I’m not currently acting; however, some may not realize that the process I’m in at this time is necessary and vital for my personal happiness and well-being.”</span></p><p><span>In a January 2012 interview with </span><i><span>People</span></i><span>, Kristy came out as gay and revealed she had been living with her partner, </span><a href=#><b>Martie Allen</b></a><span>,</span> <span>for over 20 years.
