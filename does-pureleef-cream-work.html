I mean, I find them interesting on a societal level—the fact that they’re this famous speaks a lot about what we&nbsp;currently find important and rewardable—and I respect their empire-building hustle, but other than that, I don’t care. I see what they’re selling; I’m just not buying it.</p><p>And truly, they’re selling a lot of stuff—especially on Instagram. <strong>Kim</strong> was endorsing&nbsp;prescription medication Diclegas on her account, <a href=# rel=nofollow>until she&nbsp;was slapped with an FDA warning letter</a> and took the post down. <strong>Khloe</strong>, with her newly blonde locks, is constantly posting about the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kardashian line of hair styling tools</a>. But the true Insta-shill of the family has turned out to be <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_kylie-jenner data-tag=kylie-jenner>Kylie Jenner</a></strong>, who has leveraged&nbsp;her significant social media following&nbsp;to hawk&nbsp;everything from <a href=# rel=nofollow>hair extensions</a> to <a href=# rel=nofollow>detox tea</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/timothee-kylie-selena-taylor.png><p>But my favorite moment in Kylie’s distinguished endorsement-gram career so far has been when she told all 33 million of her followers&nbsp;that her curvaceous figure is not the result of genetics or a personal trainer, but because of a “butt enhancement cream” and “breast plumping lotion” from a brand called <a href=# rel=nofollow>PureLeef</a>.</p><p>Even though no sponsorship disclosure happens anywhere on this post, one can assume that&nbsp;Kylie was paid serious money to <span>lie</span> endorse this brand. I know full well that no cream in the world is going to “stimulate fat cells”—something which would classify it as a drug and leave it open to regulation by the FDA—and give anyone a bigger ass.</p><p>And yet. There’s a part of me that’s curious about this “plumping cream.”&nbsp;It must have some effect, the part of me that still believes in integrity says. I wonder what they are—temporarily smoothing? Plumping the skin’s surface? Maybe minor swelling?</p><p>There was only one way to find out.</p><p><a href=#>As someone who occasionally does vain things for a living</a> and is not being paid a fortune by shady Instagram companies, I decided to put Pureleef&nbsp;to the test. I ordered the butt plumping cream to see if it would engineer me a Kardashian ass.</p><p>Here’s what happened.</p><p><span>Before I begin, I take stock of my raw material. My butt is fine—certainly not Kardashian-Jenner levels of rotundity, but it’s decent. It fits my frame&nbsp;and I’m generally pretty happy with it.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Kylie claimed that she applied Pureleef twice a day for a month to see results</a><span>, but I write for the internet and I don’t have that kind of time. I decide to apply it four times a day for two weeks, a hitherto unknown level of dedication to my own ass.</span></p><p>Even though this is kind of a silly thing to do, I decide to approach my butt cream experiment with a scientific attitude. To that end, for the duration of this study,&nbsp;I will&nbsp;not alter my diet or engage in any workouts that might target my ass, as both things&nbsp;could&nbsp;affect my results. I will apply the cream four times a day and measure my butt in two weeks to see the results. Since this product is meant to “stimulate fat cells,” size&nbsp;should be the variable that changes, but I will also monitor tightness, lift and skin tone for any appreciable difference.</p><p>At the outset, my ass measures&nbsp;35 1/4 inches. Respectable.</p><p><strong>Week one.</strong></p><p>My boyfriend&nbsp;and I speculate on the possible results I might see.</p><p>“What if it makes your butt genuinely huge?” he says.</p><p>“What if it makes me sprout dozens of tiny <a href=# id=auto-tag_butts data-tag=butts>butts</a> all over my butt?” I wonder.</p><p>I do not sprout multiple mini-butts. I do, however, develop a deep aversion to the smell. <a href=# rel=nofollow>The site claims that there is no fragrance</a>—just a tingling sensation, which is definitely there—but it smells like cheap, fake mint, which I do not like. Say what you will about the Kardashian-Jenner clan, but the one thing they aren’t is cheap; I can’t imagine Kylie ever using this based on the smell alone. I mean, how would it pair with Kim’s perfume?</p><p>I’m also really close to being written up by HR. “Guys, what do you think about my ass?” I ask my colleagues at least once a day. The responses range from blushing to complaints about my outfit choices: “How are we supposed to see your bum if you don’t wear pants?” Cady asks me.</p><p>That’s another thing: this cream has been dictating my fashion choices. Because it’s slow to absorb and stinks, I don’t want to wear anything super-nice in case it stains my clothing. And because I’m applying it four times a day—twice while at work—it’s easier to wear skirts and dresses, rather than my usual tight jeans. Besides, what if the smell permeates my denim? Gross.</p><p><span>At the end of the first week, my ass looks, feels and measures exactly the same as it did: it just smells like off-brand gum and is permanently tingling. Oh, the glamour! Viva la Jenner!</span></p><p><strong>Week two.</strong></p><p>I try to approach the second week of this experiment with a good attitude, but that is seriously put to the test when, on day seven,&nbsp;<span>I develop a series of red bumps on my derrière. By day eight, they’ve turned into straight-up zits—and one in particular is gigantic, painful and cystic. I know in my heart that they’ve been caused by the cream, as I’ve never in my 30 years of life had butt acne.</span></p><p>“I have ass pimples!” I frantically email my editor. She is horrified, but not nearly as horrified as I am. In fact, I’m so horrified that I manage to bring it up in two consecutive meetings.&nbsp;Hey, trauma does weird things to your sense of propriety.</p><p>On the bright side, the skin in between my butt acne is really well-moisturized. This is also likely because of the cream: it contains ingredients like macadamia, grape seed, coconut and sweet almond oil, in addition to hyularonic acid and Aloe, and mineral oil substitutes (like hydrogenated polyisobutene).</p><p>All of these things are definitely hydrating my skin&nbsp;and preventing moisture loss. But speaking as a beauty editor who prides herself on knowing a lot about ingredients, there’s nothing listed here that would affect fat cells in any way. Anemarrhena asphodeloides and Chaga mushroom extracts, <a href=# rel=nofollow>both listed ingredients</a>, actually have anti-inflammatory properties—which is weird, because isn’t swelling the entire point?</p><p>This either means that this company is adding an unlisted active&nbsp;ingredient&nbsp;to their cream (super illegal), or that PureLeef is selling straight-up moisturizer and lying about what it does (super unethical).</p><p>And&nbsp;lying they are: on the fourteenth day, as my ass zits recede and I’m left with a single red scar from the cystic monster, my butt’s measurements have not changed: it still measures 35 1/4 inches. The skin, though hydrated, is no smoother; it’s not tighter, firmer or different in any way. Myth officially busted: PureLeef Butt & Body Plumping Cream does not work.</p><p>I’m not especially sad about that, because I used this cream for a story; I didn’t actually think it&nbsp;was going to increase the size of my ass, because I’m an adult with a finely-tuned bullshit meter and I understand how ingredients work. But then again, I’m not the target market for this product. Companies like Pureleef that&nbsp;advertise exclusively by getting young, Instagram-famous celebrities to shill for them are selling their products to teenagers and young women. You know, the people already being taught to dislike their own bodies,&nbsp;and who are <a href=# rel=nofollow>willing to spend real money for Instagram popularity and validation</a>.</p><p>That’s Pureleef’s target market: the young and the vulnerable.&nbsp;And it bothers me that Kylie Jenner, who understands both the way fan worship works AND <a href=#>has experienced some of the pressure girls are under about their appearance</a>, would <span>lie about</span> actively promote a product like that.</p><p>Curves&nbsp;decidedly unplumped, I say goodbye to this experiment and reflect on what I’ve learned. I still don’t care about <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-kardashians data-tag=the-kardashians>the Kardashians</a> and Jenners, and I’ve come to terms with the fact that even if I squat it out from now until the end of time, I’ll never have an ass like Kylie’s. But you know what? I also won’t have butt acne. That’s good enough for me.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>This Is The Ultimate Butt Workout</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhsZ2mDeH6Onaaeq12lwrOxy56cn2WTp7KiuYywpqujXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
