Her parents separated when she was four years old and it was her mother who alone raised three daughters. She worked as an assistant manager at the cafeteria and always took care of the needs to raise her daughters.</p><p>Donnie still talks with her dad but she’s proud of her mother who provided all things they wanted.&nbsp;Growing up in Lake Placid, Florida, a peaceful, gorgeous town popular with retirees, Gobourne and her two older sisters didn’t have much to do besides play sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Softball was the initial love of all three sisters, inspired by their mother Shondra Crenshaw, who played in her youth but not at the college level like her children. Softball works as a type of North Star for Gobourne, providing a platform to keep her on track and on her way to college.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u10aea8e2ba7da52caea62c6974037465><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Maya Brady Biography</span></a><h3>Donnie Gobourne Career</h3><p>She participated on the All Highlands team for all four years of high school while playing under Gus Diez at Lake Placid High School.&nbsp;Her adventure as a pitcher truly began at Santa Fe College, a junior college in Florida, where she played from 2018 to 2020 and began working on her technique.</p><p>She improved significantly enough as a pitcher to begin receiving Division I interest, and she went on to pitch for the FAU Owls for two seasons.
