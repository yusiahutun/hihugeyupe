Dragons’ Den: Pitches to Riches, on BBC2 tomorrow at 8pm, tracks those who heard Dragons all say: “I’m Out”.</p><p>Here are their stories – including the damning Dragon verdicts – and occasions when the millionaires were right to be “In”.</p><h2>Sarah Willingham: ‘The LIGN Light is not an investment for me – I’m out’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712179.main_image.jpg><p><b>LORRAINE and Graham Hatton-Downward’s LIGN Light is a safety device that warns divers when they are running out of air.</b></p><p>In 2015 Dragon Sarah Willingham told the married couple: “You could have saved lives with your product but you never did. License your product.”</p><p>But the couple now sell their device worldwide and have credited their success to their failure in the Den.</p><p>Graham, from Winsford, Cheshire, said: “The Dragons saying no was in a way the best thing that could have happened to us because we suddenly became masters of our own destiny.</p><p>“We had people offering to market it for us, we had people offering to invest in it, we had people wanting to go in as partners. We took their advice on licensing.”</p><p>Lorraine added: “If it wasn’t for the Dragons we wouldn’t have been able to see the tunnel, let alone the light at the end of it.”</p><p><b>Now sold worldwide</b></p><h2>Peter Jones: ‘The Road Refresher dog bowl is just a bowl’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712180.main_image.jpg><p><b>IN 2008 Natalie Ellis showed the Dragons her Road Refresher, an on-the-go, no-spill dog bowl with a floating plate which allows the dog to drink a small amount of water but restricts the flow.</b></p><p>She asked for £120,000 for 15 per cent equity but Peter Jones and the Dragons threw out her idea.</p><p>Natalie was reduced to tears on the programme but dog owners were bowled over by her device and rushed to buy it – and she is now a millionaire.</p><p>The product is sold in 42 countries and she has sold thousands in the US – with Barack Obama even buying one for his dog Bo.</p><p>Within a year the company had turned over £1million and Natalie made her first million-pound profit in 2010.</p><p>She said: “After everything I had been through there was no way I was giving up.</p><p>“Not getting the backing of the Dragons just made me more determined.</p><p>“When I go back on Dragons’ Den I will be sitting in one of the chairs!”</p><p><b>Barack Obama bought one</b></p><h2>Nick Jenkins: ‘You shot yourself in the foot with your Blue Badge Company’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712181.main_image.jpg><p><b>ELLEN GREEN and her Blue Badge Company were snubbed by the Dragons last year.</b></p><p>But the Bristol-based company, which makes disabled parking permit holders as well as other hand-made household items, went on to win contracts to supply products to Boots stores, the Post Office and Halfords.</p><p>About 40 per cent of the Blue Badge Company’s workforce are either disabled or a primary care giver, with the company helping to remove the barriers to work that disabled people face and increasing the understanding of disability.</p><p>Ellen said: “It was quite an onslaught in the Den.</p><p>“I remember feeling my heart in my throat. I thought I’d nailed it and then suddenly I thought, ‘What is happening?’</p><p>“But we’ve developed new products and we have a listing in the Argos catalogue. Some of our leather products have gone into Harrods.”</p><p><b>Sell products in Harrods</b></p><h2>Peter Jones: ‘Your Trunki Ride-On Suitcase company is worthless’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712182.main_image.jpg><p><b>UNLUCKY Rob Law saw his pitch back in 2006 hit a snag when dragon Theo Paphitis snapped the strap off one of the sample Trunki cases.</b></p><p>The gleeful Dragon crowed that it proved the suitcases were unsafe.</p><p>But Rob forged ahead and his Bristol-based firm now turns over £7million a year.</p><p>Rob, who was awarded an MBE in 2011 for services to business, has sold more than two million Trunkis in 97 countries.</p><p>An estimated 20 per cent of Britain’s three to six-year-olds now own a Trunki.</p><p>Meanwhile Rob is also cashing in as a motivational speaker, earning £20,000 a time at business functions.</p><p>Back at his pitch he had sought £100,000 for ten per cent equity, which would now be worth £4million to a Dragon.</p><p>Rob said: “The public saw straight through Dragons’ Den. They recognised it was theatrical television and that the Trunki is a fantastic product.</p><p>“We haven’t looked back since.”</p><p><b>20% of kids have one</b></p><h2>Duncan Bannatyne: ‘Cup-A-Wine doesn’t work as a selling item’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712183.main_image.jpg><p><b>GRUMPY Duncan Bannatyne also fumed at creator James Nash: “People don’t want to buy wine in plastic glasses like that with a seal on top, it’s as simple as that.”</b></p><p>For good measure, the Dragons also branded the product “tacky”.</p><p>But after the 2009 pitch, the single-serve ready-to-drink plastic glasses were snapped up by Marks & Spencer.</p><p>The chain has so far sold more than three million glasses and the product has also won an award in the international wine “Oscars”.</p><p>And they are set to hit the shelves soon in Australia. Proud James, whose firm is based in Surrey said: “It was disheartening to be dismissed by all the Dragons, but I knew I had a great concept which would work in outdoor events, BBQ, picnics, concerts and wouldn’t give up.</p><p>“Hopefully sales of the product shows that they’re not always right.”</p><p><b>Three million sold</b></p><h2>Duncan Bannatyne: ‘Tangle Teezer has me pulling my hair out’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712184.main_image.jpg><p><b>SHAUN PULFREY’S hair brush has revolutionised the hairdressing industry – despite his knockback in the Den.</b></p><p>Celeb fans of the detangler include Emma Watson, Victoria Beckham and Cara Delevingne and now the firm is worth £65million.</p><p>The Dragons knocked back Shaun’s business idea in 2007, when he asked for an £80,000 investment for a 15 per cent stake in the company. They said they were unimpressed, with Peter Jones calling the Tangle Teezer “just a brush”.</p><p>Londoner Shaun’s unique innovation is now sold all over the world and has won more than 20 awards. With his new-found wealth he treated himself to a £1.8million house and a £100,000 Audi sports car.</p><p>Last year Shaun said: “I gained a lot of expertise from it and it has helped bring together the great team I have now.</p><p>“Fast forward to now and we’ve just turned over £23.4million, the forecast for this year is we’re going to hit £34million.”</p><p><b>Worth: £65million</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2><b>But it’s not all failure</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712185.main_image.jpg><p><b>BESIDES a few misfires with their business judgments the Dragons can count a number of big hits with their investments.</b></p><p>Among the biggest is Levi Roots and his Reggae Reggae Sauce, from 2007.</p><p>The barbecue sauce that incorporates Jamaican jerk spice was a tasty prospect for Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh, who agreed to invest £50,000 in return for 40 per cent of Levi’s company.</p><p>The British-Jamaican businessman has since built a £65million business empire and has sold 30 million bottles worldwide. He has also opened a restaurant.</p><p>In 2013 Ross Mendham showed the Dragons his gluten-free noodle range and Peter Jones was again tempted.</p><p><b>READ MORE:</b></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caught Live with Rudimental </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Artist set to be paid £6k for 20 days work in an undertakers</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time’s Up for Queen Elizabeth Hospital</a></p><p>The company, Bare Naked Foods, now supplies Holland & Barrett, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Waitrose.</p><p>Deborah Meaden was tempted to back Scott Cupit and Swing Patrol, a community based swing dance company in 2014.</p><p>Since then turnover has increased 40 per cent and the company holds the world record for the largest number of people dancing the Charleston.</p><p>Kate Cotton and Louise Ferguson persuaded Kelly Hoppen to back Skinny Tan in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2712186.main_image.jpg><p>The product claimed to be the first self-tanner that combines a natural tanning ingredient with skin-smoothing qualities to reduce the appearance of cellulite.</p><p>It is expected to make £2.5million by the end of this year and celebrity fans include Made In Chelsea’s Stephanie Pratt.</p><p>Last year “Mad” Marc Wileman wowed both Nick Jenkins and Sarah Willingham with his Sublime Science children’s party organising firm.</p><p>It is now the top party company in the UK and is expected to make £1.2million this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqZmqGcYKOnaman5%2BjwG6wxKdkq52amrC1v4ywn6hlmJ7BbrXTZpmin12ZsrS8yK2cZqGeq7K0wM6rqmabkaG5qrrGZquhnZ1ivLbAjGtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
