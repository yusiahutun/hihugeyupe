His daughter, Hailie Jade Scott has been a huge inspiration for his music, some could say a muse. He’s rapped about her in many songs, starting with 97 Bonnie and Clyde in 1998. Since then he’s referenced her in over 20 songs,</strong> <strong>including Hailie’s Song, My Dad’s Gone Crazy, and Cleaning Out My Closet</strong>, <strong>to name a few.</strong></p><p>When the <a href=#>music</a> icon rose to prominence in 1999, his oldest child Hailey was just four years old. However, she’s now 27 years old and is now an influencer and podcaster. The two recently had a father-and-daughter trip out at the Detroit&nbsp;Lions game, so let’s take a look at her now.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1439423614-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eminem-s-daughter-hailie-jade-is-all-grown-up>Eminem’s daughter Hailie Jade is all grown up</h2><p>Taking to her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, Hailie also posted a picture of herself at the NFL game attended with her father. In the caption, she penned: “football, family & seemingly ranch.”</p><p>Not only does she look all grown up, Hailie is actually now engaged. In February 2023, her long-term boyfriend, Evan McClintock, popped the question. And of course, she said yes.</p><p>The couple has been together for six years, after meeting at Michigan State University in 2016.</p><p>Asking Eminem for his daughter’s hand in marriage may be a little intimidating, and Evan actually revealed how he asked the Mockingbird singer.</p><p>On his girlfriend’s Just A Little Shady podcast, McClintock revealed he asked for permission to propose to Hailie at her birthday party in December 2022.</p><p>Explaining what happened during the nerve-wracking time, the 28-year-old said: “I saw your dad go downstairs, and I’m like, ‘I gotta do it right now, or I’m not doing it today, and I’m gonna have to schedule another time.'”</p><p>“So I just followed him downstairs, and, thankfully, he was just down there getting your cake and made it happen.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rapper-has-two-other-children>The rapper has two other children</h2><p>Hailie isn’t the rapper’s only child. In fact, he has two more daughters, Alina Scott and Stevie Laine Scott. Hailie is the star’s only biological child, who he shares with Kim Mathers, and was born on Christmas day. However, Marshall and Kim split in 2001, and again in 2006.</p><p>Alina was born to Kim’s sister in 1993, but was adopted by the Slim Shady star in the early 2000s.</p><p>Kim also gave birth to Stevie in between her marriages with Marshall, with her then-boyfriend, Eric Hartter. When the <a href=#>couple</a> reunited in 2006, the now 50-year-old adopted Stevie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-97348836-819x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lyrics-about-hailie>Lyrics about Hailie</h2><p>To throw it back, let’s take a look at some of the iconic lyrics Marshall has written about his daughter over the years:</p><ul class="inline-links multi"><li>“C’mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach, Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat,” – <strong>97 Bonnie and Clyde</strong>.</li><li>“How did you get so big? Can’t believe it now you’re 2, Baby, you’re so precious, Daddy’s so proud of you,” – <strong>Kim.</strong></li><li>“My baby girl keeps getting older, I watch her grow up with pride, People make jokes, ‘cause they don’t understand me, They just don’t see my real side,” – <strong>Hailie’s Song</strong></li><li>Hailie:&nbsp;“Daddy, what are you doing? Okay then! Everybody, listen up!”<br>Eminem:&nbsp;“I’m going to hell! Who’s coming with me?”<br>Hailie:&nbsp;“Somebody, please help him!
