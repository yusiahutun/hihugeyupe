That story has been re-told plenty in the years since, but a classic rocker's role in what happened after is less well-known.</p><p>"There were a lot of rules ... [and] I disobeyed those rules," Church explains of the Rascal Flatts incident in a recent <a href=#>Apple Music</a>&nbsp;interview, joking that his replacement was "some artist named <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> ... I don't know if she did okay or not."</p><p>Swift was a new artist, too, back then, and <a href=#>the Flatts tour was a big break for her</a>. The country-turned-pop superstar would later&nbsp;<a href=#>send Church a Gold album</a>&nbsp;with a note that read, "Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor," as a gesture of appreciation.</p><p>Nonetheless, Church hadn't done himself any favors by losing his gig with the Flatts, especially after they <a href=#>gave him multiple chances to adhere to the rules</a>. "After that happened, I was in a real not-good spot as a brand-new country music artist. I think they were the biggest tour at the time, and we got fired," he says.</p><p>That's when Bob Seger called. According to Church, the "Night Moves" singer told the country newbie that he loved his album and offered Church a 45-minute opening slot.</p><p>"At that time, I was getting 15 minutes to play in front of Rascal Flatts," Church says. "My record was 40 minutes long. I had to figure out a song. I didn't have 45 minutes, I can't even play that long."</p><p>It was a big deal. Church doesn't downplay Seger's role in keeping his fledgling career afloat, either:&nbsp;"He, in a lot of ways, saved my career. But, more importantly, he saved my faith in music," he reflects.</p><p>"He was just a guy that ... I'll never forget, my mom and dad, big Seger fans. And our first show was in Cincinnati, Ohio. And after the Flatts thing happened, I took a lot of flak, at least in the country music community. And I walked out there and I played, and then Seger came out and played "Roll Me Away." That was his opening song," Church continues. "And my mom and my dad were next to me, and I just remember that moment with my parents, and watching Bob walk out there. So, I have a special place in my heart for Bob."</p><p>With that little bit of help from Seger, Church went on to become a force within country music. The reigning CMA Entertainer of the Year, he'll release&nbsp;Soul, his third record in a three-album series titled&nbsp;Heart & Soul, on Friday (April 23).</p><p>For the record, a decade and a half later, there's no beef between Rascal Flatts and Church. In 2014, Flatts member Jay DeMarcus <a href=#>tweeted </a>that the whole thing was "ancient history," and that he and bandmates Gary LeVox and Joe Don Rooney are "very proud of what he's done."</p><p><strong>More About Eric Church's Short Time on the Road With Rascal Flatts:</strong></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 50 Eric Church Songs: His Greatest Hits and Best Deep Cuts</h2><a href=#>Eric Church</a>’s best song fall into rows.
