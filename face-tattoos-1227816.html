Otzi the Iceman was found with 61 tattoos, according to the World History Encyclopedia. Today, body art is generally accepted as the norm for all ages, genders and races. We have seen a huge surge of people adorning their bodies with tattoos of late, it is quite fashionable and sacred at the same time.” Face tattoos have emerged as a distinct and polarizing trend among the various forms of body modifications. Christy Calafati further says, “Tattoos are a form of body modification. Permanently needling ink into the dermis of the body is to modify the original skin canvas. This is a deliberate way of expressing oneself through the sacred art of tattoo.” Unlike traditional tattoos (that were typically hidden under cloths), these tattoos boldly adorn the most visible canvas — your face.
