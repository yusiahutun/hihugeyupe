The makers of a 'DIY meal kit' for growing steaks cultured from human cell samples have offered the reassurance that the concept is not 'technically' cannibalism.
Ouroboros Steaks — named for and resembling the icon of a snake eating itself — were nominated for the London Design Museum's 2020 'Designs of the Year Award'.

class=mol-factbox-title>WHAT DOES HUMAN FLESH TASTE LIKE?&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is unclear whether&nbsp;Professor Pelling and colleagues have taken a cheeky sample of their Ouroboros Steaks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Based on its concentration of myoglobin — the protein that gives muscle its colour — our flesh would likely be classified red meat, like beef.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, it has been claimed that cannibals on the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia once referred to human meat as 'long pig', given its resemblance to pork.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This assessment seems to have been shared by the noted German cannibal&nbsp;Armin Meiwes, who told RTL journalist&nbsp;Günter Stampf in a 2007 documentary that human flesh 'flesh tastes like pork — a little bit more bitter, stronger.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Similarly, the serial killers&nbsp;Karl Denke and&nbsp;Fritz Haarmann were said to have sold human flesh at market, passing such off to their customers as pork.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On the other hand, the preparation of the flesh would likely play a significant role in setting the final taste.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In fact, New York Times reporter William Seabrook wrote in his 1931 book 'Jungle Ways' that hospital-sourced human flesh he cooked — having been inspired reportedly observing ritualistic cannibalism in West Africa — tasted instead 'like good, fully developed veal.'</p>&lt;!- - ad:

class=mol-para-with-font>'Our design is scientifically and economically feasible but also ironic in many ways,' Ouroboros project artist Orkan&nbsp;Telhan told&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Dezeen magazine</a>.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We are not promoting "eating ourselves" as a realistic solution that will fix humans' protein needs,' he explained.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We rather ask a question: what would be the sacrifices we need to make to be able to keep consuming meat at the pace that we are?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In the future, who will be able to afford animal meat and who may have no other option than culturing meat from themselves?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Ouroboros Steaks the researchers produced were made entirely from human products — and therefore involved no harm to animals.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While such is often promised with lab-grown animal meat, the production of such at present is still dependant on foetal bovine serum as a&nbsp;protein-rich growth supplement — belying claims of a cruelty-free and sustainable food source.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Derived from the blood of&nbsp;calf foetuses after their&nbsp;pregnant mothers are slaughtered,&nbsp;foetal bovine serum costs around £300–700 per litre.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Foetal bovine serum costs significant amounts of money and the lives of animals,' Ouroboros Steak developer and biologist Andrew Pelling told Dezeen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-underline></span><span class=class>'Although some lab-grown meat companies are claiming to have solved this problem, to our knowledge no independent, peer-reviewed, scientific studies have validated these claims,' the&nbsp;University of Ottawa researcher explained.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=class>While no lab-grown meat has yet to be approved for sale in any country, the concept has already fostered considerable interest.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=class>The market is currently estimated at some £155 million, a figure expected to reach £431 million in the next five years.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=#
