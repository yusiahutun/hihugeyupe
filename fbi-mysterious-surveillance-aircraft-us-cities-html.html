The planes' surveillance equipment is generally used without a judge's approval, and the FBI said the flights are used for specific, ongoing investigations. 
In a recent 30-day period, the agency flew above more than 30 cities in 11 states across the country, an AP review found."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

at least 2003 that a government surveillance program might be behind suspicious-looking planes slowly circling neighborhoods.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The AP traced at least 50 aircraft back to the FBI, and identified more than 100 flights since late April orbiting both major cities and rural areas.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>One of the planes,

custody.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Those types of requests are reviewed by senior FBI officials.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The surveillance flights comply with agency rules, an FBI spokesman said.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A spokesman for the FBI told the <a style=font-weight:700 rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Washington Post</a> that his agency had not used to cellphone technology, which he calledl 'cell-site simulators', during the protests.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Those rules, which are heavily redacted in publicly available documents, limit the types of equipment the agency can use, as well as the justifications and duration of the surveillance.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Details about the flights come as the Justice Department seeks to navigate privacy concerns arising from aerial surveillance by unmanned aircrafts, or drones.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>President Barack Obama has said he welcomes a debate on government surveillance, and has called for more transparency about spying in the wake of disclosures about classified programs.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'These are not your grandparents' surveillance aircraft,' said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union, calling the flights significant 'if the federal government is maintaining a fleet of aircraft whose purpose is to circle over American cities, especially with the technology we know can be attached to those aircraft.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>During the past few weeks, the AP tracked planes from the FBI's fleet on more than 100 flights over at least 11 states plus the District of Columbia, most with Cessna 182T Skylane aircraft.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>These included parts of Houston, Phoenix, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis and Southern California.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Evolving technology can record higher-quality video from long distances, even at night, and can capture certain identifying information from cellphones using the cell-site simulators — or Stingray, to use one of the product's brand names.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>These can trick pinpointed cellphones into revealing identification numbers of subscribers, including those not suspected of a crime.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Officials say cellphone surveillance is rare, although the AP found in recent weeks FBI flights orbiting large, enclosed buildings for extended periods where aerial photography would be less effective than electronic signals
