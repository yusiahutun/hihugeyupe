Much of their fighting played out as back-and-forth sniping in the tabloids, though Crawford was always less openly hostile than Davis, whose iconic burns include the classic: "[Crawford] slept with every male star at MGM—except Lassie."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here's a full timeline of what really happened during Davis and Crawford's four-decade feud.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="article-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1933: The Origin</h2><h2 data-node-id=4 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Joan's divorce overshadows Bette's starring role.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Crawford began her on-screen career at a younger age than Davis (Crawford made her first onscreen appearance in 1925) and was already an established star by the time Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930. The first public incident of tension between the pair came out of Crawford upstaging Davis, in what would become a recurring theme.</p><img alt="Nose, Lip, Hairstyle, Chin, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Style, Iris, Jaw, Organ, " title="Nose, Lip, Hairstyle, Chin, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Style, Iris, Jaw, Organ, " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1487794750-hbz-bette-joan-embed2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Everett/Getty</span><p>Crawford circa 1925; Davis in a promotional photo for</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1933, Davis had reached a pivotal moment in her still-nascent career—the comedy Ex-Lady would be the first to feature her name above the title. Warner Bros. had planned an elaborate publicity campaign announcing Davis's new phase of stardom—until Crawford announced that she was divorcing her first husband, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., on the same day.

Crawford was on Pepsi's board of directors at the time (her late husband, Alfred Steele, was a Pepsi executive), so Davis had a Coke machine installed in her dressing room just to spite her. In one scene where Jane beats Crawford's character Blanche, Crawford requested a body double because she didn't trust Davis not to hurt her for real. She was reportedly proved right during a close-up in which a body double could not be used, where Davis hit her hard in the head—some reports claim hard enough to require stitches, though Davis insisted that she "barely touched her."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Crawford got her payback during the filming of another scene, where Jane drags Blanche out of bed and across the room. Knowing that Davis had back problems, Crawford made herself as heavy as possible—either by filling her pockets with rocks, wearing a weightlifter's belt or simply making herself deadweight, depending on which report you believe—and deliberately ruined several takes, forcing Davis to drag her around again and again until she was in agony.</p><img alt="Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" title="Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" width=1024 height=780 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1487776687-gettyimages-470659492.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Davis and Crawford on the</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="article-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1963: The Oscar</h2><h2 data-node-id=44 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Bette gets the nomination, but Joan takes the stage.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even when filming had wrapped on Baby Jane, the tension kept simmering, helped along by the Academy, which opted to give Davis an Oscar nod for her performance—along with supporting actor Victor Buono—while overlooking Crawford.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not only did Crawford campaign hard against Davis, who was the favorite for that year's Best Actress prize, but she made arrangements to get up onstage herself at any cost. Noting that several of that year's nominees were unable to attend the ceremony, Crawford offered to collect the Best Actress award on their behalf. And so, when the absent Anne Bancroft's name was read out, Crawford went up to accept the Oscar on her behalf as Davis watched in shock, and <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Du67yQna4Q" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="posed happily" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">posed happily</a> with Bancroft's award alongside the night's actual winners backstage.</p><img alt="Joan Crawford (accepting for Anne Bancroft) with Gregory Peck, Patty Duke And Ed Begley with their Oscars, at the 35th Academy Awards." title="Joan Crawford, accepting an award on behalf of Anne Bancroft, poses with other winners at the 1963 Oscars" width=1024 height=1008 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1487776393-gettyimages-585266847.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Joan Crawford, accepting an award on behalf of Anne Bancroft, poses with other acting winners—Gregory Peck, Patty Duke and Ed Begley—at the 1963 Oscars.</p><h2 data-node-id=48 class="article-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1964: The Sequel</h2><h2 data-node-id=49 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Joan ditches her next project with Bette.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hoping to replicate the success of What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?, Warner Bros. commissioned a spiritual sequel of sorts called Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte. It was based on a short story by Henry Farrell, who wrote the novel that Baby Jane was based on, and would see Davis and Crawford reunite on screen as a different pair of women locked in psychological warfare, again directed by Aldrich. Crawford dropped out after a week and a half of filming, claiming that she was unwell—but <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=vNz_v91Wul4C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=Reputedly,+Crawford+was+still+incensed+by+Davis%27s+attitude+on+Baby+Jane+and+did+not+want+to+be+upstaged+again,+as+Davis%27s+nomination+for+Best+Actress+convinced+her+she+had+been&source=bl&ots=RF_TWZ2Wji&sig=_iznP04v3o7kMqnA_-TmzslXUdM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIyemOiaTSAhWmrVQKHeGjCm8Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=Reputedly%2C%20Crawford%20was%20still%20incensed%20by%20Davis's%20attitude%20on%20Baby%20Jane%20and%20did%20not%20want%20to%20be%20upstaged%20again%2C%20as%20Davis's%20nomination%20for%20Best%20Actress%20convinced%20her%20she%20had%20been&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she was in fact still reeling" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">she was in fact still reeling</a> from the indignities of Baby Jane, and felt at risk of being upstaged by Davis again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Aldrich hired a private detective to track Crawford's movements, he wasn't able to get her back to set, and finally the choice came down to recasting her role or canceling the film altogether. After several actresses turned down the part, Olivia de Havilland was finally hired in Crawford's place.</p><h2 data-node-id=52 class="article-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1977: The End</h2><h2 data-node-id=53 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Bette gets snarky after Joan's death.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following Crawford's death in May, Davis is <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://weheartvintage.co/2015/04/08/great-feuds-from-classic-hollywood-1-bette-davis-vs-joan-crawford/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="often quoted" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">often quoted</a> as having said the following: "You should never say bad things about the dead, you should only say good… Joan Crawford is dead. Good." But it's almost impossible to find an actual source for this infamous sick burn, so take it with a pinch of salt.</p><h2 data-node-id=55 class="article-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1978: The Legacy</h2><h2 data-node-id=56 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Joan and Bette actually had a lot in common—including ungrateful daughters.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether or not Davis actually delivered that brutal, brief eulogy, she would ultimately soften towards Crawford, even coming to her old enemy's defense following the publication of Mommie Dearest, a damning memoir by Crawford's adoptive daughter Christina that chronicled the abuse she suffered at the hands of her mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was not Miss Crawford's biggest fan," <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/crawford200803 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Davis acknowledged" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Davis acknowledged</a>, "but, wisecracks to the contrary, I did and still do respect her talent. What she did not deserve was that detestable book written by her daughter… To do something like that to someone who saved you from the orphanage, foster homes, who knows what. If she didn't like the person who chose to be her mother, she was grown up and could choose her own life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Davis went on to admit that she "felt very sorry for Joan Crawford, but I knew she wouldn't appreciate my pity, because that's the last thing she would have wanted, anyone being sorry for her, especially me. I can understand how hurt Miss Crawford had to be. Well, no I can't. It's like trying to imagine how I would feel if my own beloved, wonderful daughter, B.D., were to write a bad book about me. Unimaginable."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That last part would soon become bitterly ironic, to a degree that would seem heavy-handed if you wrote it in a screenplay. In 1985, B.D. Hyman would indeed follow in Christina's footsteps, and publish a book entitled My Mother's Keeper, in which she described Davis as a selfish, emotionally abusive alcoholic. For what it's worth, this account of Davis is much more contested than the account of Crawford in Mommie Dearest, and public reaction was largely sympathetic towards Davis. Hyman's adopted brother disagreed so strongly with the book's publication that he disowned her.</p><img alt="Bette Davis and Joan Crawford on the set of What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?" title="Bette Davis and Joan Crawford on the set of What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?" width=806 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/07/1487012494-gettyimages-151790864.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.
