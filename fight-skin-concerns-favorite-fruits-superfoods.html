Rich in vitamin A, B, C, calcium and iron, they improve the immune system, teeth and gum health and iron absorption. I was fortunate enough to try the berries as a jam (a popular way it is served in Finland) while at an event for Finnish skincare brand Lumene, and they taste amazing – a little tart but still sweet.</p><p>On The Skin: Cloudberry seed oil has natural antioxidants that brighten the skin as well as plant sterols that hydrate the skin.</p><p>Product To Try: We recommend the entire Vitamin C+ collection.&nbsp;Since using <a href=#>Lumene Vitamin C+ Radiant Beauty Drops</a> ($19.99, Walgreens.com), my skin is noticeably smoother, brighter and <a href=# id=auto-tag_acne data-tag=acne>acne</a>-free. Actress and Lumene spokesperson Byrdie Bell loves the brightening effects of the cloudberries as well. “The cloudberry in the Vitamin C+ noticeably brightens my complexion.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2012/08/superfood.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skincare2.jpg><p><a href=#>Related Article:&nbsp;<strong>5 Foods Every Fitness Gal Should Eat</strong></a></p><p><strong>Strawberries</strong></p><p>In The Body: Strawberries are packed with potassium that regulates blood pressure.

However, that natural sugar treats fatigue by providing a boost of energy. The fruit also aids in treating constipation and indigestion.</p><p>On The Skin: Because it contains tartartic acid, the fruit breaks the bonds that hold dead skin cells together in the uppermost level of the epidermis, making it a great ingredient to use in exfoliators and cleansers.</p><p>Product To Try: We love Skin Ceutical’s Equalizing Toner ($30, Skinceuticals.com), because it restores and balances the skin to its natural state by eliminating dead skin cells.</p><p><strong>Apples</strong></p><p>In The Body: An apple a day does keep the doctor away. At least for athletes, that is. A new study by researchers at the University of Iowa have recently found that ursolic acid from the apple peel promotes the growth of muscle and brown fat – both of which are very important for athletes.</p><p>On The Skin: Quercetin, an antoxidant found in apple peels, is a great treatment for preventing acne by calming skin. It also treats acne by slowing down inflammation and helps to clear skin.</p><p>Product To Try: Test out Super Acne Solution ($50, Getsuper.com) to prevent break outs, exfoliate and brighten the skin.</p><p><a href=#>Related Article: <strong>Are You Getting Too Much Protein?</strong></a></p><p><strong>Blueberries</strong></p><p><strong></strong>In The Body: Among their many benefits, blueberries are packed with amino acids, thereby reducing lactic acid buildup for faster recovery time after a hard workout.</p><p>On The Skin: Blueberries are rich in anti-oxidants such as anthocyanin and Vitamin C that fight the formation of free radicals that can damage skin’s structure. This protection fends off wrinkles and improves skin’s firmness.</p><p>Product To Try: Yes To Blueberries is a complete anti-aging line that repairs and prevents skin damage. A great product to start with is the Daily Repairing Moisturizer with SPF 30 ($19.99, Yestocarrots.com) because it does it all — boosts collagen production, skin rejuvenation, eliminates appearance of wrinkles and protects against UVA and UVB rays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhtZ2uDdXyOn6CgoKRiwKy1zWaaqKaTmr%2Bvv4yfmK%2Bnop7BpnnFq6yirKNiwLa8xKudqKeUqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
