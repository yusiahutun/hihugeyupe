If you interrogate her, the only answers you will be getting is few limited words and head gestures. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>With tattooed body and profound fashion sense, you may mistake her for being some brutally honest girl who throws her tantrums all around in media.</p><p>However, it isn’t the case. She loves keeping the&nbsp;low profile, and you can’t simply squeeze out details of any personal matters from her. Right here, find out all there is know about the personal side of her life story. Learn about whether she has a boyfriend or is she married below.</p><h2>So, what makes this star remain mom about her personal affairs?</h2><p>When humans refuse to remember things, the most prominent reason is that it isn’t worth remembering. Cappie’s reason is no exception. Throughout her life, she has encountered all sorts of hardships and crisis. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Cappie was brought up in the “rough” neighborhood in West Chicago. No matter how hard her mother Vanessa Pondexter tried to segregate Cappie from them by raising her in church, the impacts couldn’t be avoided for much. Her 16-year old cousin was gunned down ruthlessly which would go on to alter her sentiments broadly.</p><p>The life-changing moment actually came later with Leon Smith incident. During her high school days at John Marshall Metropolitan High School, her then boyfriend King Alumnus and Leon Smith, a mentally troubled NBA prospect, began stalking her. Things took the ugly turn when <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Things took the ugly turn when Smith, who has “Cappie” tattooed in his hand, rammed into her mother’s car, vandalized it and threatened. Smith was found guilty and penalized with probation and a restraining order, but it left behind a huge imprint on tender Cappie’s heart. The unnecessary hype&nbsp;that the incident gathered taught her to maintain isolation between “media” and “personal affairs.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“That was a terrible situation, but I'm glad it happened at such a young age,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she said to Chicago Tribune talking about it.</a> “I learned from that."</p><p>Also, her honest opinions and remarks in social media haven’t been a pretty one either. In 2011, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her tweet regarding Japan Tsunami dragged her into bitter controversy.</a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Pointing out at the destruction, she tweeted, “What if God was tired of the way they treated their people in their country! Idk guys, he makes no mistake. U just never know! They did pearl harbor so u can't expect anything less."</p><p>She did come back with the&nbsp;apology later, but the spark had already turned into a flame. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I wanna apologize to anyone I may hurt or offended during this tragic time. I didn't realize that my words could be interpreted in the manner which they were. People that know me would tell u 1st hand I'm a very spiritual person and believe that everything, even disasters happen 4 a reason and that God will shouldn't be questioned but this is a very sensitive subject at a very tragic time and I shouldn't even have given a reason for the choice of words I used."&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>It does seem a compulsion for Cappie to remain away from publicity, but her on-court absence can’t be afforded.</p><h2>Be alongside Pondexter as she narrates her everyday life in the video:</h2><p><strong>Caption: 24 Hours featuring WNBA Star, Cappie Pondexter.</strong></p><h2>A glance at her Splendid Career:</h2><p>The Olympic gold medalist with US Women Basketball team has a legacy built with her deeds in court. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Chicago Sky star commenced her career with the Phoenix Mercury after being drafted as 2nd overall in 2006.

With Jamierra Faulkner and Courtney Vandersloot out for the season, the load falls on the recently drafted players&nbsp;Tori Jankoska and Makayla Epps.
