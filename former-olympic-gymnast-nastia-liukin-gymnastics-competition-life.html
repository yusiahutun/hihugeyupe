With nine world championship medals, four all-around U.S. national championships, and five Olympic medals, the star is undoubtedly one of the most decorated athletes in the game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Her outstanding achievements have made her an iconic symbol of female success in the world of sports. As part of her continued contribution, the legendary gymnast hosts an annual gymnastic competition, the Nastia Liukin Cup. Through the events, she has opened the way for several level-10 gymnasts to compete in elite and international competitions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=THE_NASTIA_LIUKIN_CUP></span><strong>THE NASTIA LIUKIN CUP</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nastia Liukin <a href=#>established</a> her own gymnastic competition in 2010 in collaboration with USA Gymnastics. They announced the partnership months after the icon’s reverberating win at the 2008 Beijing Olympic games, marking the start of a new gymnastic era.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The Nastia Liukin Cup, named after its founder has become one of the most significant gymnastic competitions in the world. It takes place annually in the United States, with Liukin serving as the indefatigable host.</p><p>The competition, which features junior and senior fields, celebrates America’s top junior Olympic gymnasts, launching their careers into global excellence. Some beneficiaries of the annual competition, who went on to achieve international fame include Gabby Douglas, Ashton Locklear, and Morgan Hurd.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=NASTIA_LIUKINS_FEUD_WITH_SHAWN_JUSTIN></span><strong>NASTIA LIUKIN’S FEUD WITH SHAWN JUSTIN</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Aside from facilitating her rise to stardom, gymnastics has also helped Liukin build some of her closest relationships, including a friendship with her BFF, Shawn Johnson East. Little wonder the 31-year-old feels obliged to give back to the gymnastic community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nastia-Liukin-and-Shawn-Johnson.jpeg><p>Long before Justin and Liukin’s friendship took form, a lasting <a href=#>feud</a> between the two gymnasts existed for years. East once recounted how the fallout began right after their faceoff at the Olympics. It continued for eight years until East reached out to Liukin via email while waiting in line at the airport, during a trip to Dallas.</p><p>The 31-year-old gymnast responded within 30 seconds of receiving the email, and so the two women resolved their differences. The rest, they say, is history.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=NASTIA_LIUKIN_ENDURED_A_BROKEN_ENGAGEMENT></span><strong>NASTIA LIUKIN ENDURED A BROKEN ENGAGEMENT</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Unlike her BFF who settled down with the love of her life, Liukin has not been as successful in her <a href=#>love life</a>. In 2010, she was linked with Olympic figure skater Evan Lysacek. However, the duo later debunked claims of romance between them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Years later, another love interest, hockey player, Matt Lombardi surfaced in the gymnast’s life. In 2015, the icon announced her engagement to Lombardi, but they never made it to the altar. Their relationship crashed three years after their engagement and the two went their separate ways.</p><p>Following her breakup from Lombardi, the Olympic gold medalist kicked off her romance with the football star, Sam Martin. They called it quits in 2020, after dating for barely a year.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=LOMBARDI_DISHES_ON_HIS_AND_LIUKINS_BROKEN_ENGAGEMENT></span><strong>LOMBARDI DISHES ON HIS AND LIUKIN’S BROKEN ENGAGEMENT</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Through the years, many have wondered what led to the breakup between Liukin and her former fiancé, Lombardi. Although Liukin’s representative confirmed that she and Lombardi chose to part ways mutually and amicably, it still left many questions unanswered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Olympic-Gymnast-Nastia-Liukin-and-Fiance-Matt-Lombardi-Split-After-3-Year-Engagement-1024x538.jpeg><p>Five years after the epic split, the retired hockey player shed more light on their short-lived engagement and eventual breakup. During an appearance on the “Adulting” podcast in March 2020, the athlete-turned-entrepreneur <a href=#>revealed</a> he and Liukin never planned to break up after their engagement. However, things happened along the line, which led to their split.</p><p>Going further, he affirmed that he never regretted his relationship with the gymnast. According to Lombardi, their relationship triggered the establishment of his now-bolstering company, Beam. The hockey star also confirmed he and his former fiancee have remained amicable even years after their separation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=HOW_NASTIA_LIUKIN_MAKES_HER_MONEY></span><strong>HOW NASTIA LIUKIN MAKES HER MONEY</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It is general knowledge that most athletes tend to descend into a life of limited means post-retirement. But not Nastia Liukin, who has maintained her affluent lifestyle several years after quitting the games. This leads many to wonder how the gymnastic champion <a href=#>makes enough money</a> to keep up with her life of affluence.</p><p>The singular answer lies with her numerous endorsement deals. Liukin has landed endorsement deals with several top-rated companies over the years. These include AT&T, Herbal Essence, Adidas, and many athleisure fashion brands.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Aside from endorsements, the star runs a YouTube Channel, embarks on tours as a motivational speaker, and makes guest appearances in movies and TV shows.</p><p>No doubt this remarkable young woman deserves a place among <a href=#>legends</a> who leave their marks on earth by showing other women how limitless their potentials could become once tapped into.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ks7C%2BzJ6pZqecrrqxtcJmnrKlnpbAtXnNmqqtoZFiuarByqKlZp%2Bporuiv9Oimqxlk6S6sbHToquip55iuaqyxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
