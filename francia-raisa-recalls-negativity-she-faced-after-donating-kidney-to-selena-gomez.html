"It was definitely a personal choice. It was definitely just an act of kindness no matter what the rumors are."</p><p>Gomez was actually the one that revealed that Raisa donated one of her kidneys to her in an emotional post that shows them lying in hospital beds following the surgery.</p><p>"There aren't words to describe how I can possibly thank my beautiful friend Francia Raisa. She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me. I am incredibly blessed. I love you so much sis," Gomez said on Instagram at the time.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The pair even sat down <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>on the Today show</strong></a> to discuss their experience in an emotional interview where Gomez reflected on how Raisa's donation saved her life.</p><p>Gomez also spoke about her decision to be candid about the kidney transplant, her illness and mental health in her My Mind & Me documentary, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-explains-how-my-mind-and-me-documentary-influenced-her-body-image-exclusive-193809><strong>telling </strong><strong>Entertainment Tonight</strong></a>, "In a weird way, I feel like it is a time capsule of things -- a period of my life where I look back, and I actually feel bad for that version of myself."</p><p>She added, "I think that it was good for me to see how I was responding to my body, the way that I was acting and the way it was so irrational in moments, and I think it was really healing for me to see that and get it out."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0ed9d031-d51f-481b-8e7c-628195dc4bdd data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f7b8c94-2acc-42ae-b97d-b6bdbf42b3c1 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f1/5by4/2024/03/14/f1aab8fdda474f5b8db3cd4370893c9d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Selena Gomez Talks Hitting 'Rock Bottom' Before Managing Mental Health: 'I'm In a Much Better Place Now'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Even though Raisa's choice to donate her kidney to Gomez came from a good place, in the years since, the How I Met Your Father actress said there's been a lot negativity surrounding her decision, amid rumors that the pair had a falling out.</p><p>"Listen, we experience it with every hero in the world. I'm sure there was bad stuff written about Martin Luther King after he passed. People are always just gonna look for something negative," she said on the podcast.</p><p>"I put myself in a position where people are interested in my personal life -- I wish that wasn't so crazy. Sometimes people need a distraction from their own life. If I'm that distraction, I guess I just have to be grateful that people care about my feelings.

I've just been on my own journey ever since. It definitely did a lot for me. My favorite thing is I'm able to talk to other donors."</p><p>While rumors of a feud between Raisa and Gomez began swirling two years ago after Gomez named Taylor Swift as a <a href=#><strong>"friend in the industry"</strong></a> and not Raisa during a <a href=#><strong>Rolling Stone</strong></a> interview, &nbsp;the pair have since reconciled their friendship, with the "Love On" singer taking to social media to celebrate Raisa's birthday.</p><p>"She and I are still getting to know each other again," Raisa told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>USA Today</strong></a> in December about <a href=#><strong>repairing their friendship</strong></a>.</p><p>While they hadn't spoken in almost six years before coming together again, Raisa said &nbsp;she didn't regret her decision to give Gomez a kidney.</p><p>"Obviously, you know, I gave the girl a kidney so everyone felt a certain way and I was asked for years and years and years, 'Do you regret it?' and I was like, 'No, the relationship has always been there.'
