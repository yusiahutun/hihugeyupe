The event features a golf tournament, runway show, luncheon and the Jack & Friends concert. The fashion portion has featured designers like Jason Wu and Alice + Olivia, while the golf tournament gives attendees a chance to play 18 holes with Brown, Ingram and McConaughey.</p><p>The gala — which Brooks will headline — is the biggest fundraiser, where guests can bid on extravagant luxury items and experiences. In the past, Maseratis and safari tours have been on the auction block. MJ&M donates all of the proceeds to their beneficiaries.</p><p>Shortly after the gala, Brooks will kick off his <a href=#>Garth Brooks/Plus ONE Las Vegas Residency</a>. He will be in Sin City in May, June, July, November and December of next year.
