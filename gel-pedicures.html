However, thanks to the LED light, you don't have to worry about waiting for your nails to dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can follow these same steps if you're doing your pedi at home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-do-gel-pedicures-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Do Gel Pedicures Cost?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pedicures are usually a little more pricey than a manicure. At Sunday's Nail Studio, a 60-minute gel pedicure costs $70. The price of a pedicure depends on your location, what's included, and your technician's skill level, but you can expect the treatment to fall in the $40 to $80 range.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-do-gel-pedicures-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Do Gel Pedicures Last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's why getting one is worth it. According to Lin, pedicures generally last longer than manicures. "There's just less wear and tear on your toes, even if you're on your feet all day," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gel manicures usually look decent for two to three weeks, depending on your technician's skill level and the product that was used, so you can expect even more wear from a gel pedicure.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-gel-polish-damage-your-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can Gel Polish Damage Your Nails?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just like a gel manicure, gel pedicures have the potential to disturb the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>health of your nails</a>. However, Lin says a lot of the damage can be avoided by getting the polish properly removed so you're not peeling off your nail with the polish. Also, spacing out how often you get a gel pedicure can help reduce <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>nail damage</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-remove-a-gel-pedicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Remove a Gel Pedicure?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Professionals often cover the nails in an acetone-soaked cotton ball and aluminum foil. After the foil is removed, the gel should then slide off. Any remaining polish is usually gently filed off the nail bed. You can do the same process at home, Lin says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At home, keep the nails covered for 10 to 15 minutes. Then, the gel should lift-off itself. "If not, use a wooden stick to help remove it fully," Lin suggests.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-someone-get-a-gel-pedicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Should Someone Get a Gel Pedicure?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gel mani and pedis are ideal for someone who doesn't want to frequent the salon that often. They generally <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>last longer</a>, so you don't have to deal with polish dulling or chips. Lin recommends a gel pedicure if you're going on a vacation or plan on spending a ton of time at the beach or a pool. Chlorine and salt water are both worn on regular nail polish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLSmuIypnJ2hk6q%2Fpr8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
