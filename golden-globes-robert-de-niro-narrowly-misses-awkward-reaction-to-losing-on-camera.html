We saw dazzling gowns and dapper suits grace the Red Carpet – <a href=#>fashion</a> wasn’t cast aside at this star-studded event. We saw Tinsel Town’s talented stars grace our screens again for the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> event. It marked the start of the <a href=#>awards show</a> season, and we can’t get enough. Although, when Golden Globes nominees Robert De Niro and Robert Downey Jr were up against each other in the same category, it was a bit awkward.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-de-niro-s-reaction-as-golden-globes-winner-announced>Robert De Niro’s reaction as Golden Globes winner announced</h2><p>One thing that can make an awards show event awkward is having the exactly same name as your opponent. It’s what <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a> faced at the Golden Globes when Robert Downey Jr was in the same category. They were both nominated for the Best Supporting Male Actor in a Motion Picture area.</p><p>Robert De Niro who has appeared in many films was nominated for his part of William King Hale in Killers of the Flower Moon. He starred in <a href=#>Martin Scorsese’s movie beside Leonardo DiCaprio</a>.</p><p>Downey Jr came along over his role in Oppenheimer, rubbing shoulders with <a href=#>Cillian Murphy</a>.</p><p>Other stars in the category included <a href=#>Ryan Gosling in Barbie</a>, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo in Poor Things and Charles Melton in May December.</p><p>Before the winner is announced, each of the nominees have a camera on their face to see their reaction of being named – or not. It can cause a stir if someone who believes they should win, doesn’t, or allow star’s to show off their humble side if their name is in deed read out.</p><p>Although Robert De Niro’s reaction at the Golden Globes to hearing Downey Jr take the crown wasn’t Angela Bassett style. (Her Oscars meme will go down in History). But it looks like his ears took notice when they heard the first word – ‘Robert’. However, it was a second later when the rest of the winner was announced, with ‘Downey Jr’. It’s just bad luck two actors in the category share the same name. We’re glad he didn’t prematurely stand up or congratulate himself – that would have been awkward.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> actors also have things in common. Both played characters portrayed by real people.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-host-takes-swipe-at-hollywood-star-with-awkward-joke>Host takes swipe at Hollywood star with awkward joke</h2><p>It wasn’t the only awkward moment of the night, as Robert De Niro’s recent personal life update was fuel for a Golden Globes joke by the host.</p><p>Jo Koy’s monologue had several highs and lows. He even took aim at <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, and she didn’t seem that amused, we’ve got to say. But he took a swipe at De Niro as well.</p><p>He quipped: “Your last performance has got to be your&nbsp;greatest&nbsp;performance ever. How’d you get her pregnant at 80?”</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star, now 80, welcomed his seventh child last year when he was 79. It made headlines, as it was similar to Al Pacino who recently added to his family.</p><p>But it doesn’t seem there were any hard feelings over the gag. De Niro can be seen laughing along with the audience.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-downey-jr-s-hilarious-speech>Robert Downey Jr’s hilarious speech</h2><p>Downey Jr, who played Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer, took to the stage to accept his win.</p><p>The jokester cracked a gag at the start of his acceptance speech.</p><p>“I took a beta blocker, so this is gonna be a breeze,” he quipped as the audience roared into laughter.</p><p>Beta blockers are medication that manage abnormal heart rhythms or beats, and can block or decrease adrenaline.</p><p>He continued: “A sweeping story about the ethical dilemma of nuclear weapons grosses 1 billion dollars, does that track? No, unless and but because Universal went all in on Christopher Nolan, to direct Cillian Murphy with Emma Thomas producing with Emily [Blunt] and Florence [Pugh] and this cast and crew and helped them render a goddamn masterpiece.”</p><p>The Marvel star then made another joke at his agents.</p><p>He added: “They had the gall to say I needed to re-start my career, it’s so fun proving agents right.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WFcLPOpZuepl2cubCuxKxkq6eSmr%2B1ecOeZKehoqR6r63Rq6awpKliuqq%2F0p6qZpmnoMSivsNmqZ6Zk6m2sLqMraZmpJ%2Botq%2BzjKilZpuRorKzrY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
