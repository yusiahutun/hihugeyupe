Unfortunately my husband and I are going through a separation and I moved in with my parents home down the bayou,” she wrote in a statement obtained by People from her private Facebook account. “I have the support of my family and friends to help guide me through this. I am learning to listen to my heart. Right now <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>I need time to let myself find</a>… who I am.”</p><p>In an interview with People in December 2023, Blanchard said she planned to marry the Louisiana middle school special education teacher again after her release so they could enjoy festivities with their loved ones.</p><p>“We do plan on having a reception/redo wedding with all of our family and our friends and the dress and the cake and everything because we deserve that. I deserve that. He deserves that,” she said. “Our prison wedding was just something to where we can make our vows to each other. It was something that meant something to us. And I think the party is kind of for everybody else and us, but mostly for everybody else.”</p><p>They did plan to have kids one day but telling them about her mother’s murder would have been a challenge. “We’re in love,” says Gypsy. But also, “It’s hard because I’m going into a new life and I’m newly married, and I’m going to have kids one day, and I’m going to have to explain to my kids why their grandmother on mommy’s side isn’t around. And that’s going to be a really hard conversation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1ub2ljZLS6vNKyZKuno5p6rLHNZqyro5WneqOtwqRkraeXmsGpsdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
