And while adding a new <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>buzzy ingredient</a> into your routine may keep you from experiencing FOMO, it might not be what you really need. Our advice? Simplify your routine — especially when it comes to hair. For instance, do you really need a hair oil and a hair serum? Maybe not. So to help you decide which is best for you, we turned to two experts to find out what both products do, who should use them, and how to use them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to discover the difference between hair oil and hair serum once and for all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-hair-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Hair Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the name implies, hair oil is an oil-based product. According to Isfahan Chambers-Harris, a trichologist, Ph.D. Scientist, and founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Alodia Haircare</a>, the formula typically consists of at least two carrier oils (like avocado, coconut, and almond) and essential oils (like lavender and lemongrass).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An oil offers a handful of benefits for the hair and scalp, including scalp stimulation, maintaining moisture within the strand, and aiding in length retention. In turn, the oil can help hair feel softer and appear shinier.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-hair-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Hair Serum?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hair serum is a lightweight product that covers the outer surface of the hair, acting as a seal or protectant. Hair serums typically contain silicones or silicone-like substances that sit on top of the hair strand, Dr. Chambers-Harris tells us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Hair serums have benefits such as taming frizz and flyaways, adding shine, shielding against humidity, softening your strands, and helping with damage caused by chemically damaged hair or hair that has been over-styled with heat tools," shares <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Deaundra Metzger</a>, an Atlanta-based celebrity hairstylist.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-difference-between-hair-oil-and-hair-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Difference Between Hair Oil and Hair Serum?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The major difference is the products' ability to penetrate the hair strand. Oils tend to be absorbed by the hair, while serums typically feel like they're coating strands. "Hair oil conditions and nourishes hair, directly impacting overall hair health, but no such impact is seen with the use of hair serums, says Metzger. "Hair oil penetrates deep into the hair shaft to nourish hair from within, whereas hair serum merely sits on the surface and forms a layer."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's best to think of a hair serum as a shield or armor for the hair. If you're styling your hair with hot tools, Dr. Chambers-Harris suggests prepping hair with a silicone-based serum for heat protection.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-should-use-hair-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Should Use Hair Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All hair types and textures can use a hair oil, but how you use it will vary. "Drier hair types such as textured hair tolerate oils well," Dr. Chambers-Harris says. "Straighter hair types can use oils but should use them before shampooing." Rinsing the oil out with shampoo will still deliver the benefits without weighing down straight and/or fine hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-should-use-hair-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Should Use Hair Serum?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They're also a universal product, however, if you're prone to frizz or have chemically-treated hair, you can especially benefit from adding a hair serum to your routine. Just be aware of the ingredients, specifically if you have curly/textured hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you are wearing your hair in its curly/textured state most of the time, you should be careful with using silicone-based serums because they can cause buildup over time and block moisture from getting in, leaving your hair feeling and looking dry — particularly if you are using a non-sulfate shampoo to wash your hair," explains Dr. Chambers-Harris.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-use-hair-oils></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Use Hair Oils?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a number of ways to use hair oil in your routine based on your hair type and its needs. "You can oil the hair and scalp before shampoo. You can use as a hot oil conditioning treatment. And you can use them as a 'sealant' to seal in the cream-based hair conditioner that you used for styling," says Dr. Chambers-Harris.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How much product you use will vary by hair length. "If you're rocking a shorter style, then one to two small pumps are enough, while longer styles may find three to four pumps more appropriate," says Metzger. Again, it's important to note that if you have straight hair, oil is best used as a pre-shampoo treatment to prevent weighing hair down.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-use-hair-serums></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Use Hair Serums?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for hair serums, when you use one in your routine will depend on its purpose. When you're applying it, Metzger suggests going by hair length. "A single pump of serum will suffice for mid-length hair, while long hair may require a bit more," the stylist says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-favorite-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Favorite Products</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alodia-nourish--grow-healthy-hair-and-scalp-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Alodia Nourish & Grow Healthy Hair and Scalp Oil</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With avocado and rosemary oils, this moisturizing treatment nourishes the scalp and hair follicles to soothe dryness and support growth.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ceremonia-aceite-de-moska></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ceremonia Aceite de Moska</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to nourishing hair, Ceremonia's oil works to rebalance the scalp by removing product buildup and excess sebum.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fable--mane-holiroots-pre-wash-hair-treatment-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fable & Mane HoliRoots Pre-wash Hair Treatment Oil</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Use Fable & Mane's pre-shampoo oil treatment inspired by ancient Indian hair rituals to strengthen and repair damaged or dry hair.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-olaplex-no-9-bond-protector-nourishing-hair-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Olaplex No. 9 Bond Protector Nourishing Hair Serum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Olaplex's serum is designed to protect hair that's been weakened by chemical treatments from future damage.
