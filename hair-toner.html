Even though stylists consider toner to be an essential, final step of a hair coloring appointment, it remains a mystery for so many — even those with color-treated hair. And with so many hair products and services available to us, it's easy to want to skip toner when you aren't sure what it does.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, it turns out that skipping hair toner is a very common mistake people with color-treated hair make. To find out more about the treatment, we turned to two of the best celebrity colorists around — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Suite Caroline</a> salon master colorist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Aura Friedman</a> and Redken celebrity colorist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Tracey Cunningham</a> — to break down how toner works and why no dye job is complete without it.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>RODNAE Productions/ Pexels</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-does-hair-toner-do></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What does hair toner do?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Colorists use many different words to describe a toner," explains Cunningham, who adds that stylists often use 'hair gloss' or 'glaze' interchangeably when describing hair toner. "When I'm working behind the chair, I typically call it a hair gloss because it makes the benefits – shine, luster, and a touch of color – super intuitive for my clients."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, a toner is a gel-like, demi-permanent hair coloring product that temporarily deposits color onto hair to enhance or soften hues while adding megawatt shine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the dye in toners is demi-permanent, Cunningham says it loses vibrancy each time hair is washed, but will typically last about four to six weeks. As such, it's an easy, low-commitment option for people who want to try out different shades.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images/George Doyle</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-different-kinds-of-toners></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are there different kinds of toners?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are glosses and toners," explains Friedman. "Glosses deposit color but do not lighten hair, whereas toners may contain ammonia, which can lighten hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Friedman prefers to use glosses over a traditional toner to blend color together to achieve harmony between hues and because glosses are effective "on universal hair types to give hair more body with a boost of protein."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tinted shampoos and conditioners are also considered a type of hair toner and are key for caring for color-treated hair at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am talking to all my clients about toning shampoos right now," says Cunningham. "Using a toning shampoo, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Redken Color Extend Blondage Shampoo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>conditioner</a> for blondes and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Redken Color Extend Brownlights Shampoo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>conditioner</a> for brunettes, means you're putting in the work to maintain your color at home. For blondes, you're keeping your hair bright and brass-free, and for brunettes, this is all about preventing those red and orange undertones from coming through."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-hair-toner-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How does hair toner work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A toner is usually applied after a single or double process, says Cunningham. However, she adds that it can also be used in-between color services to maintain and refresh your hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of her go-to moves is to add a gloss to a blowout appointment for an extra upgrade and instant shine boost. Take it from a pro: "It's fabulous!" the stylist exclaims.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Glosses have a lifespan of six to eight shampoos, and Friedman recommends applying a gloss every eight weeks to revitalize hair color and strengthen strands for maximum volume.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Hilary Duff Gives Herself Bright Blue Hair</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-do-i-need-to-use-hair-toner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why do I need to use hair toner?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Toners have way more benefits than just adding dimension to hair color. Thanks to their versatility, Cunningham says toners or glosses are likely part of your in-salon color service already — whether you know it or not!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To get technical, using an acidic demi-permanent toner is an essential part of a color appointment to strengthen the hair's cuticles and reduce damage. This specific type of toner "closes the hair cuticles and helps bring the hair's pH levels back to a normal, healthy state after a color or lightening service," says Cunningham, who also uses an acidic toner during <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>root touch-ups</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When doing a root touch-up, I'll apply alkaline permanent color to the regrowth (aka roots) and acidic Redken Shades EQ Gloss to the previously colored hair, to get the best results and minimize damage."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Translation: you walk out of the salon with vibrant, shiny, and most importantly, healthy hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a quick service that works wonders on hair to tone color, refresh highlights, and correct uneven tones," adds Cunningham. "A hair gloss offers big results that you can see and feel."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-any-cons-to-using-hair-toner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are there any cons to using hair toner?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Daniel de la Hoz / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the dye in toner is temporary and loses vibrancy with each wash, there isn't a huge risk factor with using it. However, with every color appointment, it's wise to bring your stylist a photo of the final look you're envisioning. And from there, "your colorist can work out how to make that look come to life," says Cunningham.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-i-use-hair-toner-at-home></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can I use hair toner at home?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are absolutely desperate, go for a gloss or a demi-permanent color, says Friedman. This is definitely not the time to be a risk-taker, and you should follow the instructions exactly as they are outlined on the box, she adds. Also, stay far away from toners that contain ammonia in the formulation — this is how people end up with orange hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My dream," says Friedman, "is to have my clients not touch any sort of color, and instead focus on getting hair strong with hair masques like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>K18 Peptide Masque</a>, that way when I finally get them back in the salon, we can go to the extreme with color, because their hair will be so healthy!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eYlrazedOopZ6q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
