“For me it’s the spitting image of Flourish and Blotts, where young sorcerers buy their magic manuals,” adds Nerea Moyeno, a 24-year-old Spanish tourist.
Moyeno hopes soon to get her hands on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a new play imagining the fictional boy wizard as a grown-up father of three, which has its official premiere in London on Saturday after winning rave reviews for press performances."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Although it does not move – unlike the Grand Staircase at Hogwarts school of wizardry, there is a definite resemblance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rowling was a loyal customer when she lived in Porto between 1991 and 1993 and likewise was frequently to be found at the nearby Cafe Majestic, a famed belle epoque cultural haunt for the city’s intelligentsia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was at one of the cafe’s white marble low tables that Rowling penned an early draft for what would become Harry Potter and the Philisopher’s Stone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/07/29/e2b530fe-5550-11e6-98ca-49b1c9e3ed10_486x.jpg>Back then she was just another customer sipping a cup. It would be some years later, from 1997, when her books had already made her reputation worldwide, that Lello booksellers and Majestic’s waiters would highlight their link to the author.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Tourists have suggested putting up a plaque to mark the writer’s passage, but we don’t know yet where to put it,” says Fernando Barrias, son of the owner of the legendary Majestic, whose customers have included actress Romy Schneider.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yes, we used to frequent the Majestic,” says Rowling’s former husband, Portuguese journalist Jorge Arantes. He still lives in the brown and green house the former couple lived in after marrying in 1992.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They split up after a nocturnal argument in November 1993. Two weeks later, Rowling, then 28, left Portugal for good, taking her four-month-old daughter with her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/07/29/e1ba9c02-5550-11e6-98ca-49b1c9e3ed10_486x.jpg>“In those first weeks in Portugal I wrote what has become my favourite chapter in the Philosopher’s Stone, ‘The Mirror of Erised’ – and had hoped that, when I returned from Portugal I would have a finished book under my arm. In fact, I had something even better: my daughter, Jessica,” Rowling explains on her official website.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two decades on, guide Bruno Correia shows off some of Porto’s haunts which inspired the author.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Those include a tower looking rather like the Astronomy Tower where Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore meets his end and the Crystal Palace Gardens which bring to mind the Forbidden Forest, as well as the university, home to black-caped students.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Their uniforms look very much like those of young sorcerers. Tourists even call them Harry Potters,” says Correia, 33, a fan since his teens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kHJwb2xpanyprdGrsGaon6nBpr6MramaoZxivbC%2B066emqRdn7huvs6wo6Kml6h6qrrSqaCrmaSevK8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
