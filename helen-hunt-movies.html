Her performance was her first career bump and led to three Golden Globe awards for Best Actress and four Primetime Emmy Awards for Lead Actress. Hunt’s warm smile and natural charisma made viewers feel like a family member or neighbor you want to get to know better, a feeling which would be enhanced later on through numerous Helen Hunt movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-51096759-edited.jpg><p>But truth be told, Helen Elizabeth Hunt was an actress decades prior to taking on the role of Jamie Buchman. She began working as a child actress in the 1970s with early roles on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, the feature Rollercoaster (1977) and alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay Wagner</a> in an episode of The Bionic Woman.</p><p><strong>MUST READ:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mary Tyler Moore Show Cast: Surprising Facts About The Beloved ‘70s Comedy’s Stars</a></p><p>Several sitcom appearances through the 70s and 80s kept the young actress busy. Her love of show biz was apparent and why not? She had show biz in her blood — literally. Dad was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gordon Hunt</a>, a film, voice and stage director; and her uncle <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Hunt</a> was also a director.</p><p>At the age of five, she began attending plays with her dad and remembers seeing the original production of Godspell in a church basement. “And that was it,” Hunt says. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I didn’t even know if I wanted to be acting or singing or directing</a>. I just wanted to be in that building.” To this day, theater holds a special place in her heart as an actress, writer and director.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/as-good-as-it-gets_bu1UEc-edited.jpg><p>By the mid and late 80s, Helen Hunt movies became more frequent and were aimed at a teen audience. In the eyes of some, Hunt’s Oscar winning performance alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Nicholson</a> in As Good As It Gets, was as good as she got.</p><p>Her career trajectory went into the stratosphere and Helen Hunt movies became a regular event. But her multi-talents didn’t stop there. Here is a look back at some of the many Helen Hunt movies – some just okay and some as good as they get.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Trancers (1984)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>This was Hunt’s first major film role and the first in the Trancers series. She portrays Lena, a punk rock girl, in this sci-fi film.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Girls Just Want to Have Fun (1985)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Hunt plays Lynne Stone, the friend of an army brat in this comedy with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shannen Doherty</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Peggy Sue Got Married (1986)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Francis Ford Coppola</a> movie, Hunt is featured as the daughter of a woman on the verge of divorce who is her mom’s plus one for mom’s high school reunion. The film was a box office success and received positive reviews, ultimately finding itself nominated for three Academy Awards.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Stealing Home (1988)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Gradually making her way into a more adult realm of Helen Hunt movies, she appears as the sister of Billy Wyatt, played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Harmon</a>, and a cast featuring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jodie Foster</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harold Ramis</a> in Stealing Home, a coming of age romantic drama. The film was a box office disappointment, but has since garnered a cult following.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Next of Kin (1989)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Hunt is the pregnant wife of a respectable lawman opposite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Swayze</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Neeson</a>.&nbsp;The action thriller features <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Stiller</a> in one of his earliest roles.&nbsp;</p><p>(Click through to our sister site’s roundup of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Swayze’s best movies</a>!)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Kiss of Death (1995)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Kiss of Death is a loosely-based remake of the 1947 film noir classic of the same name featuring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel L. Jackson</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicholas Cage</a>. Hunt plays Bev Killmartin, wife of an ex-con living in Queens.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Twister (1996)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In this disaster film — not in terms of box office, but rather climatic disaster – Hunt stars opposite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Paxton</a> as storm chasers researching tornadoes. Twister was the second highest grossing film of 1996. During the filming, both actors were temporarily blinded by bright electronic lamps halfway through filming and needed hepatitis shots after shooting in a particularly toxic ditch.&nbsp;Maybe it was a disaster film after all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. As Good as It Gets (1997)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The movie brought Hunt super fame. And not only did she bring home an Oscar, but she formed a friendship with co-star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Nicholson</a> who plays a crotchety author that frequents the diner where Hunt’s waitress character works. The single mom and cranky author form a love-hate relationship on screen but off screen, Hunt saw a different side of Nicholson — not cranky and not the wild man of film lore.</p><p>“My expectation about Jack was that he would be unpredictable and not bother with the mundane things that I bothered with,” Hunt told The Guardian. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The truth is he’s an acting class guy</a>, so he and I had all the same questions. I felt as if I was with a friend and in acting class rather than an iconic movie star. It was just some frequency we both could tune into that was very, very compatible.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Dr. T & The Women (1997)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Hunt is one of the women that enters the average life of a wealthy gynecologist, played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Gere</a>. The romcom is directed by Robert Altman and features a stellar cast of women — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Farrah Fawcett</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laura Dern</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shelley Long</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Hudson</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liv Tyler</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tara Reid</a> — as the various patients he encounters in his everyday life. Country singer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyle Lovett</a> composed the film’s music.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Pay it Forward (1997)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Hunt plays an alcoholic single mother to 12 year-old Trevor McKinney (The Sixth Sense‘s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Haley Joel Osment</a>).&nbsp; The film is loosely based on the novel of the same name. Set in Las Vegas, it recounts Trevor’s goodwill movement known as pay it forward.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Cast Away (2000)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>A favorite film of co-star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Hanks</a> himself, Hunt portrays the long time girlfriend of Hanks’ FedEx employee, Chuck Noland, who finds himself marooned on an uninhabited island.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the thought of Kelley is what mainly keeps Chuck motivated to stay alive until he’s rescued, Kelly, who probably thinks he’s dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the meantime.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MUST READ:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Hanks Through the Years: 27 Rare Photos of the ‘Nicest Guy In Hollywood’</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12.

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>A longtime admirer of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woody Allen</a>, Hunt appears in this film alongside Allen playing a wisecracking efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels.&nbsp;Allen is known to be very secretive with his scripts and while Hunt was allowed to read the entire script when she was offered the part, she had to do so in one sitting and then return it to the courier who was waiting to take it back to Allen.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>14.
