Signs along the route suggest April and May would be good months for the hike, when Luciola cerata Olivier, a species of firefly, stages its spectacular light shows.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">10 most magnificent Christian churches in Asia, from Seoul to Singapore</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As enjoyable as it is, Elephant Mountain is merely my warm-up for a hike in mountainous central Taiwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My base is Guguan, a small hot spring town about 100km from Taipei that I reach via a one-hour bullet train journey to the city of Taichung, followed by a 50km taxi ride.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As my driver threads his way past other hot spring resorts wedged into the forested valleys above Taichung, the air becomes muggier and is scented by the five-leafed pines that blanket this part of Taiwan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/10/61c346f4-fba3-4332-a21c-ee643c9b125a_b3ee84ec.jpg>Opened in 2019, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hoshinoya Guguan</span></a> resembles a James Bond lair. Its low-slung buildings are connected by stone paths that weave through thick tracts of bamboo. In the guestrooms, private onsen and ryokan-style sleeping areas are set back from floor-to-ceiling windows that make the most of the mountain views.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most people come here to hike, and a network of trails starts from the rear of the property. Activities on offer at reception – alongside lakeside afternoon teas and masterclasses in the weaving techniques used by the Atayals, a local indigenous group – include guided hikes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My hike with Hsieh Ping-Yu, a local guide, begins in the crease of a butterfly-filled valley carved out by a river that flows from Xueshan, which at 3,800 metres (12,467 feet) is the region’s tallest peak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/10/22d73c74-4430-49b0-ab80-e30eb49bda12_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Atayal people are farmers, and the valley is lined with persimmon and dragon fruit plantations, which are guarded by dogs whose primary purpose is to fend off bears and monkeys. The air is rich with the sweet scent of hinoki wood, planted by the Japanese who colonised Taiwan in the late 1800s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Between refrains on his bamboo jaw harp – a small stringed instrument that is plucked while held close to the lips and uses the mouth for resonance – Hsieh tells me that the Japanese outlawed many of the beliefs and traditions (including the playing of the jaw harp) held by the Atayal people, the largest indigenous group in Taiwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Later, he explains how the valley’s pines produce phytoncides – antibacterial and antifungal organic compounds that help the trees fight disease. They’re released into the air, and can benefit humans, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/10/1251bc00-5b3d-4c3b-9d83-36b2ef710516_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is why forest bathing is so popular in Taiwan, Hsieh says, as we pause to soak up the view of hills, surrounded by thick forest and the chirping of rosefinches and woodpeckers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Guguan village is little more than a cluster of family-run restaurants and tiny hot springs hotels. On its main thoroughfare is a public foot bath where locals meet to share green tea while tiny fish provide a complimentary pedicure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the small restaurants lining the village’s main street offers lunch dishes that include bitter melon with salted egg, pork intestines with ginger, and barking deer. I order a stew containing pigs’ ears, which, it turns out, are surprisingly delicious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/10/b82fd256-fb97-4346-924f-37898463ff98_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the Guguan Visitor Centre, there’s a small museum focusing on the area’s geology. I learn that Guguan means “barrier”, which refers to the towering mountains either side of the valley.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The museum’s mascot is a smiling Atayal tribesman, which seems only fitting considering that, in 1907, it was they who discovered the hot springs here. Later, the tribe oversaw the construction of Guguan’s first hot springs facilities, which opened in 1927.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The museum also has a foot bath, warmed by salt and sulphide-rich spring water that has worked its way to the surface through fissures surrounding the Guguan fault line, 3.5km below.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">5 of the best Japanese inns to stay at that marry tradition and modernity</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It, too, is filled with tiny fish, and there’s something rather wonderful about enjoying an impromptu pedicure while soothing tired limbs and soaking up the views of the lush green mountains surrounding this hot-springs hotspot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The writer was hosted for free by Hoshinoya Guguan</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtpcGloZnyptcqipaBlpJa2uK3NZp%2Bor11nerG7z66jmqpdqb%2BitcusZK2ZmaWyqnnAp5tmn6WcwqK6jKGgoKCcnrSpwIyvmKuhlanGbrvPraCopqNivKeyxKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
