Bishop of Hong Kong Island Matthias Der Tze-wo will serve as the celebrant, the highest-ranking priest to officiate the six services at the church on Sunday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/30/8f8c8020-e93b-4055-94ae-124685d2d28e_c7092b25.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Koon, who will preach at the service, told the Post on Friday that placing the flag in the cathedral on October 1 would serve as a test, and the practice could be implemented on all future National Days.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hongkongers are simply overreacting,” he said, referring to the voices objecting to his idea of displaying the flag during church services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than 140 people signed an online petition against Koon’s flag-raising idea and other remarks he made in recent months on local churches’ relationship with the country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Koon said: “It is a day of celebration for those who believe the country has been performing well.
