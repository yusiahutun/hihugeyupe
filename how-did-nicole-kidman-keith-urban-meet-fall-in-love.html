They started dating just a few months later, and as Kidman recalls to the <a href=#>WSJ Magazine</a> in an interview for its May 2020 issue, she fell for Urban almost immediately, when he took her on a motorcycle ride to Woodstock, N.Y. The romantic date even included a picnic that he had packed.</p><p>“I was a goner — I mean, c’mon," Kidman says, adding that his "mellow" personality helps balance her out.</p><p>"He’s pretty much the flip side of neurotic," she observes.</p><p>Urban and Kidman wed&nbsp;in Sydney, Australia, on June 25, 2006. They welcomed their first daughter together, Sunday Rose, in 2008, and their second daughter, Faith Margaret, followed in 2010.</p><p>Now married more than 15 years, the couple are very careful to balance out their family time against their very public careers, even if it means sacrificing certain opportunities.</p><p>“We have a system worked out to keep the family together,” Kidman says. She often picks projects that shoot on the East Coast or when her children are not in school.</p><p>“When Keith’s not touring, it’s much easier. He’ll be on tour next year, and then I just don’t work as much. Literally — it will become imbalanced, and we will change it. We don’t have the answers, but the one thing we do know is that we will not jeopardize us.”</p><p><strong>See Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman's Sweetest Pictures Through the Years</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoaenYrGqsIynoJynnJp6rLXDppinZZuatrW0jK6pm5meYrqmsdNmnZqknGK2r3nLqK2eZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
