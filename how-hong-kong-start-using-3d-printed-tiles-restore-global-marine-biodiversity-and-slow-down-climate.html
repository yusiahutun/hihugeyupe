Besides providing crucial breeding ground and shelter for fish, reefs act as natural buffers against storms and surges, protecting an estimated 200 million people living along the world’s coastlines from violent weather, according to the Coral Reef Alliance. The annual economic value of seafood, tourism and recreation associated with reefs is estimated at US$2.7 trillion, according to the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/17/07285880-8e05-4e91-8447-6878f2505f89_65f6af9b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But reefs are also among the most fragile ecosystems, as corals are vulnerable to rising seawater temperatures and acidity. If the world’s temperature were to rise by 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, it would wipe out 99 per cent of all remaining corals, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Archireef differs from other 3D printers that create reefs, such as Australia’s Reef Design Lab. Yu uses terracotta, a non-toxic material, and Archireef aims to be a nursery for corals to grow, instead of seeking to replace natural reefs.</p>In January, Archireef began deploying tiles to rebuild 40 square metres of artificial reefs seeded with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">rescued coral fragments in Abu Dhabi’s coastal waters</span></a>, backed by the emirate’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ.
