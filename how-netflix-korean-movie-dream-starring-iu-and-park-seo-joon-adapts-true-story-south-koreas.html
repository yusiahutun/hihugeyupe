He is at first indifferent to helping the team; later, as he learns about their lives, he becomes protective of them.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How fans helped Killing Romance become Korea’s 2023 cult movie sensation</span></p></a></h3>Hong-dae is often challenged by So-min (<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lee Ji-eun</span></a>, the singer and actress also known under her K-pop name IU), a filmmaker shooting a documentary about the team. She’s anxious to cast “pitiful” players to add drama to her film. Their animosity towards each other, reflected in sharp, fast-paced banter, can be hilarious.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The film isn’t about Hong-dae. It’s about homeless people,” Lee insists. “We brought Hong-dae in to make the film more entertaining, because homelessness isn’t exactly the most entertaining subject, right?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The battle I faced was in not making caricatures of the real players. There had to be some compromises here and there. All I can say is I don’t think this was received that well commercially [after being released in Korea in April].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/d41fa82d-49ec-4510-bcb1-8cc0cbafd37b_ab7ae757.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Covid-19 pandemic played a huge factor in the film’s production. Lee had originally planned to shoot the tournament scenes in Colombia, but had to use Budapest, in Hungary, instead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They were the most important scenes, and we shot them under the worst conditions,” he says. “It was so cold you could see the players’ breaths, which we had to CGI out later.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Working under a tight budget, Lee had to rehearse all the games in South Korea. Because the Homeless World Cup operates with a smaller pitch, he could use only two cameras; a larger crew might have caused safety issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/043f5d16-6f17-4bcd-b733-49f355c20904_4559f17d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We had to shoot the games exactly the same as we rehearsed,” he says. “We weren’t able to make even little changes here and there. I think that was the hardest part for me, to not change things. To let things happen the way we rehearsed them, just because we were running behind schedule.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee was subdued during our talk, perhaps marshalling energy for his premiere that evening. The NYAFF chose Dream as its centrepiece film, an honour he seems to have misgivings about.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s not my job to be satisfied with each and every project that I do,” he says. “If you don’t know the context of this story, you might perceive it as too typical. Audiences aren’t obligated to provide themselves with that context before they see it. But without that information, they might think this is just another homeless story.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s something I still think about – whether the way I’m telling or delivering the story could have been different. That does give me pause.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/6a1ee2c7-56ba-48bf-92d1-2dbdd781df0e_4f022e96.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some of the film’s harshest material deals with the organisations and companies who try to take advantage of the homeless players, such as sponsors, who gain publicity by promising to help, only to quietly withdraw their pledges later. When a team official asks a bank officer for a donation, he answers, “Why would we do that?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everyone surrounding the team is out for something, whether or not it helps the homeless. Even the documentary filmmakers look for “plot twists” to help their script. When Hong-dae questions her tactics, So-min replies, “Do you think we’d get this story organically in two months?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to say my intent wasn’t to criticise anyone outright,” Lee says. “What we depicted in the film, that’s actual reality. That’s how people act. It’s just a fact of life. I guess as a filmmaker I tried to introduce these stories as they were, and are. It’s up to the viewers what to make of them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/a6b75828-7c6e-4947-a33a-79215aecc688_4f022e96.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The director screened Dream for the players and the original documentary filmmakers, and was gratified when they told him the movie felt true to their own experiences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There were some tears in the audience,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That may be because Lee took the time to explore how the homeless lived off the pitch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Going into this film, my intentions were that I didn’t want one particular character to stand out in the narrative,” he says. “Balancing that out between all the characters, that was definitely something I had in mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/fc15bede-f840-4fe6-a44e-27eac5b28883_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What Lee does in Dream is find ways to individualise the players and develop them beyond stereotypes. He credits the cast with doing this, but it’s really his sensitivity and empathy that bring them to life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“To give you an analogy, I would say that the homeless players in this film, they’re people who have been sort of temporarily herded out of the fences of society,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A character like Hong-dae is someone who’s there on the field with them, but he’s standing right inside the fence. That gives him the proximity to really see them and be with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/381d31fd-d978-4a54-bd7e-358bfb42f8c5_4f022e96.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I feel that what homeless people want is to lead ordinary lives. Because of that, I actually don’t think there is a stark distinction between people like you and me, ordinary people living ordinary lives, and the people who yearn to live ordinary lives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s what I wanted to depict, that there is not much that stands in between us.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dream starts streaming on Netflix on July 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRlnaTDqrHSaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtpcW9iaHypu9ZmpZ6slqG2uXnKqKmemZ5iurDCyJ5knaqVlrpuv9Oaqauhnpx6qsGMmqWdZaCWv6x50p6mZqKfpLturcOap62rXam%2FtrGMrKuoqqliwLDB06FkpKeimq60</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
