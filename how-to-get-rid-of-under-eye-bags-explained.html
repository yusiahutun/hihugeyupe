And if your bags don’t just disappear after a good night’s sleep, the gradual aging of your skin is likely to blame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The eye sits in a fat pad, and that fat pad is held in place by fibrous tissue,” Woolery-Lloyd says. “As we age, the fibrous tissue that holds the fat pad in place can weaken, and the fat in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g43798071/best-eye-creams-for-dark-circles/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lower eyelid" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">lower eyelid</a> can bulge forward. This is called prolapse of orbital fat.” But here’s some encouraging news: No matter the source of your swollen under-eyes, there are products to use, actions to take, and lifestyle changes that can be implemented to help get rid of the bags under your eyes—or at the very least, minimize their appearance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We’ve consulted top dermatologists for a deeper dive into some of the causes of under-eye bags, plus their recommendations on treatments that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g4745/best-eye-patches-1114/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=soothe class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">soothe</a>, de-puff, and generally <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g43267126/best-eye-cream-for-wrinkles/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=smooth class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">smooth</a> the delicate orbital area.</p><h2 data-node-id title="What causes under-eye bags?" data-anchor-id=what-causes-under-eye-bags class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">What causes under-eye bags?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As previously mentioned, aging is the most common cause of under-eye bags. “The natural aging process leads to the loss of collagen and elasticity in the skin,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://stefanikappeldermatology.com/about-us/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stefani Kappel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Stefani Kappel</a>, board-certified dermatologist and founder of skincare brand MDAiRE. “As collagen diminishes, the delicate skin around the eyes weakens, making under-eye bags more noticeable.” Kappel adds that a person’s anatomy or genetic predisposition, thin skin, fluid retention from dietary habits, dehydration, allergies, smoking, and lack of sleep can also contribute to drooping under-eyes.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related:</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id title="At what age do under-eye bags appear?" data-anchor-id=at-what-age-do-under-eye-bags-appear class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">At what age do under-eye bags appear?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While puffy under-eyes can pop up in your 20s, Kappel says the concern is more prominent once you reach your 30s, 40s, and older. “Our dermis, epidermis, and subcutaneous tissue thin over time, which can make these under-eye bags look more pronounced. This is all heavily influenced by personal anatomy, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle,” she notes. However, strategic skincare habits may help reduce the issue, which makes the case for regularly using an eye cream or set of patches (more on that later).</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related:</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id title="Can you get rid of under-eye bags?

Depending on the severity of the issue and its cause, a more invasive approach to address your under-eyes may be needed. “Once the bags develop, it’s challenging to remove them unless planning for in-office or surgical procedures,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://marmurmedical.com/teresa-song-md/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Teresa Song" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Teresa Song</a>, board-certified dermatologist at Marmur Medical in New York City. The most ideal scenario is to take steps to help prevent them from forming.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Implement healthy lifestyle changes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Getting enough shut-eye and drinking water aren’t solutions to every beauty problem, but they definitely don’t hurt. In fact, Kappel says that sufficient rest and proper hydration with regular exercise “can help minimize fluid retention in that area and promote overall healthier skin.” Essentially, if buying a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a46823585/stanley-cup-trend-fashion-week/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stanley Cup" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Stanley Cup</a> and a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g40154379/best-silk-pillowcases-for-skin/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="silk pillowcase" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">silk pillowcase</a> is the motivation you need to implement healthier habits, go for it.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Invest in an eye cream with hydrating, tightening, or brightening benefits</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Consider this your sign to add an eye cream to your daily skincare lineup. The step can make a big difference in minimizing the appearance of under-eye bags. Song says to look for creams with ingredients like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g28339109/retinol-eye-cream/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=retinol class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">retinol</a>, peptides, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g44939896/best-caffeine-eye-creams/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=caffeine class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">caffeine</a>, along with antioxidants, like vitamin C and green tea.
