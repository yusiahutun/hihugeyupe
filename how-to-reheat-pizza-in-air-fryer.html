We’re here to show you how to reheat pizza in an air fryer: It takes just a few minutes and your slice will taste just as delicious as it did straight out of the box!</p><p>Keep reading to find out how to reheat pizza and deep dish pizza in an air fryer. Plus, learn the best tricks for storing leftover slices in the fridge so that it doesn’t go to waste!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How long does pizza last in the fridge?</h2><p>According to Jason Kennedy, pizza reviewer for <a href=# rel=noopener>Minute Man Pizza</a>, leftover slices will last about three to four days in the fridge — as long as it is stored properly. He suggests not keeping it in the cardboard delivery box. It doesn’t have a tight enough seal to maintain the pizza’s freshness in the fridge which could cause it to spoil faster.</p><p>Instead, Kennedy recommends using an airtight container like a Ziplock plastic bag (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Walmart, $9.81</a>) for individual slices. Wrapping each of the slices in foil would also work. Either way, you can place them in the fridge to have over the next few days.</p><p>This is important because eating pizza that’s not stored correctly could result in <a href=#>food poisoni</a><a href=# rel=noopener>n</a><a href=#>g</a>, which causes flu-like symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. So to stay on the safe side and avoid any stomach troubles, use these storage tips for the best results.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best way to heat up leftover pizza?</h2><p>We’ve all all wondered <a href=#>how to reheat pizza</a> so that it tastes just like it was delivered from the pizzeria. It can also be a pain to heat up our oven for just one slice of pizza. Warming it up on the stove usually involves splashing some water in a pan or cast iron skillet to create a steamy effect so that the cheese can melt. Microwaving seems like the convenient route that’s also the least time-consuming, but it can leave the pizza dough soggy when it’s first warmed up.</p><p>But just because these three options aren’t ideal doesn’t mean we have to eat a cold slice of pizza. An air fryer is the perfect kitchen appliance to use instead because it doesn’t require adding any extra water or oil. This makes it a healthier method of cooking and reheating because it relies on hot air circulating around the food. It’s also able to get everything super crispy without any messy oil splattering everywhere.</p><p>Pizza also won’t dry out using this method — as long as you reheat it correctly. So it’s definitely worth sticking a couple of slices into an air fryer to get that pizzeria quality freshness again. If you’re looking to snag one that’ll reheat any leftovers and fit right in with the rest of your kitchen appliances, check out our list of <a href=#>the best air fryers</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can you use an air fryer to reheat pizza?</h2><p>Chef Nini Nguyen of <a href=#>The Spruce Eats</a> decided to see how well air fryers compared to reheating slices in the microwave, stove, and oven. First, she noted that her air fryer had a pizza setting to properly heat it all the way through. Be sure to check your own air fryer’s manual and get familiar with its various functions for the best results. If the model doesn’t come with a pizza setting, then preheating it to 360 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes will work just fine.</p><p>Nguyen placed a slice of pizza directly on her air fryer rack and let it heat up for four minutes. Compared to the microwave, stove, and oven, she was impressed by how the air fryer pizza was able to get the best browning on the crust with gooey, melted cheese on top.</p><p>She also noted that, depending on the size of your air fryer, this method works if you need to heat up two to three slices at a time. Don’t forget to keep an eye on the pizza by checking it every few minutes to make sure doesn’t&nbsp;burn or overcook.</p><p>Watch the video below to see Nguyen test out this air fryer trick as well as several others to find the best way to reheat pizza:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to reheat pizza in air fryer toaster oven?</strong></h2><p>You might notice that some air fryer models come with a toaster oven feature that allows you to also bake and broil foods. These usually have small oven-like racks instead of a basket to put food into when you’re ready to use it.</p><p>Although this type of air fryer is unique in its own way, you can still use Chef Nguyen’s technique as a guide for reheating pizza at home. Take a look at our picks for the <a href=#>best air fryer toaster ovens</a> that are great for reheating and cooking almost any food you could imagine!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How long to reheat deep dish pizza in air fryer?</strong></h2><p>Pizza comes in all different shapes and sizes. Deep dish pizza, in particular, is definitely in a class of its own when it comes to eating (you might need a fork and knife!) and reheating it. Compared to thinner crust pizza slices, it’ll take a little longer to warm it up — but it’s worth the wait!</p><p>Luckily, the team at <a href=# rel=noopener>The Windup</a> has a foolproof method for reheating deep dish pizza in an air fryer:</p><ul><li>Turn on the air fryer and set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and let it preheat for 10 minutes.</li><li>Place the pizza slices directly on the rack or basket. If you don’t want to clean any cheesy stains, then place the slices on a piece of parchment then put it on the rack.</li><li>Once the slices are in the air fryer, lower the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Let the pizza reheat for six to seven minutes or until the toppings and cheese are heated and the crust is golden brown. Be sure to check it every minute while it’s heating up to make sure it doesn’t burn.</li></ul><p>So the next time you can’t finish a whole pie from your favorite pizzeria, use these tips to enjoy it later on.
