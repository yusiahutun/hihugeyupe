  Telegram doesn’t send you a notification when someone blocks you, so you’ll have to find out by yourself. To make the job easier, we’ve put together a list of ways to check if someone has blocked you on Telegram."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Or have they just been away for a while and didn’t have a chance to reply to you?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Telegram doesn’t send you a notification when someone blocks you, so you’ll have to find out by yourself. To make the job easier, we’ve put together a list of ways to check if someone has blocked you on Telegram.</p><h2 id=verify-that-the-account-wasn-rsquo-t-deleted>1. Verify That the Account Wasn’t Deleted</h2><p>There’s a chance you’re not blocked on Telegram, but the account you’re trying to reach out to has been deleted. If the owner has deleted their account, you’ll not be able to send messages, see their profile picture, or call.</p><p>Fortunately, you don’t have to guess if they’ve deleted their account as Telegram will inform you. However, it might take a while for the change to reflect within the app, so you should restart Telegram before checking.</p><p>If you see the <strong>Deleted Account </strong>message, you should <a href=#>consider a Telegram alternative</a> if you want to keep talking to the contact.</p><p>If the account is still active, go through the list below to figure out if they blocked your Telegram account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=check-if-your-messages-remain-undelivered>2. Check if Your Messages Remain Undelivered</h2><p>Similar to other social media apps, Telegram will display a tiny checkmark next to your messages. This shows the person you’re texting has received the message. If there are two checkmarks, it means the person has also read the message.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/telegram-checkmark-1.jpg><p>If you notice Telegram shows a single checkmark next to your messages for a long time, there’s a chance that they’ve blocked you on Telegram. However, they might try being sneaky and <a href=#>read Telegram messages without marking them as read</a>.</p><p>There’s also the case when that person is trying to <a href=#>limit screen time</a>, so don’t be too impatient while waiting for a reply.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=check-if-you-can-see-their-profile-picture>3. Check if You Can See Their Profile Picture</h2><p>Another telltale sign that someone blocked you on Telegram is that you can’t see their profile picture. Nevertheless, they could've simply removed their Telegram profile picture or changed their Telegram privacy settings and hid their picture.</p><p>Also, you can’t see a Telegram account profile picture if they didn’t add you as a contact.</p><h2 id=see-if-you-can-view-their-online-status-and-activity>4. See if You Can View Their Online Status and Activity</h2><p>If you’re not sure if someone blocked you on Telegram, you should take a quick look at their activity status. If you see them as <strong>Online</strong> or <strong>Seen last time about</strong>, there’s nothing to worry about. However, if you keep seeing the <strong>Seen a long time ago</strong> status, there’s a chance they blocked you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/telegram-activity-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/telegram-activity-2.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this isn’t the most accurate way to figure out if they blocked you. If they haven’t used Telegram in a while, you’ll still see the <strong>Seen a long time ago</strong> status.</p><p>Also, you should know that if you <a href=#>hide your Telegram status</a>, you won’t be able to check other people's statuses as well.</p><h2 id=try-to-call-them>5. Try to Call Them</h2><p>If someone blocked you on Telegram, there’s no way you can voice or video call them. As soon as you try to call them, Telegram will display the <strong>Failed to connect</strong> message.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/call-telegram-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/telegram-call-2.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>If you notice the same message while trying to call other Telegram contacts, you might be dealing with a faulty internet connection. In this case, switch from mobile data to Wi-Fi or connect to a different network and try calling them again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=try-add-their-account-to-a-group-chat>6. Try Add Their Account to a Group Chat</h2><p>As we’ve discussed, there’s no error-proof way to tell if another user blocked you on Telegram. There might be account settings or network issues that could stop you from messaging or calling them.</p><p>If you still can’t tell if they blocked your Telegram account, you should try adding them to a group chat. If you get the <strong>USER_IS_BLOCKED </strong>message, you’ve been blocked on Telegram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/telegram-chat-blocked-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/telegram-chat-2.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>If you’re already part of the same group chat, they won’t be able to see your texts or interactions within that group or channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-you-blocked-on-telegram>Are You Blocked on Telegram?</h2><p>There’s no error-proof way to tell if someone blocked you on Telegram. But if your messages aren’t delivered after a few days, you can’t call them, and their profile picture is missing, chances are they’ve blocked your account.</p><p>However, there’s always the chance they’ve accidentally blocked you. The best way to find out is to ask them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxuwMSlo2ahlmLAsLnEqKWeZZKhvKS3xJ1ksqelYryvedOeo56fopa6cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
