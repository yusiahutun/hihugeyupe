The celeb line-up - which is as yet unknown - are in for the usual host of tricks and tribulations, and none are more challenging than the Bushtucker Trials."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I have tried very hard but I'm definitely not going to eat an insect."</p><p>However, there are also plenty of benefits to the eating trials, as Roxane added: "However, some body parts are actually very nutrient dense. Most of the Bushtucker dishes are very high in protein such as crickets, crocodile meat and pig’s tongue, which have a high amount of vitamins and minerals."</p><p>And <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dr Sunni Patel</a>, scientist-clinician and gut health coach, said: " <span>T</span><span>hese are delicacies already consumed by natives of particular countries.

For example, if you’re hotter, you may experience a decrease in appetite while your body makes more effort to cool the body down instead.</p><p>"There’s not much evidence out there just yet to support this so more research needs to be done in this field."</p><p>And Dr Sunni added that this can lead to "exhaustion", elaborating: "I <span>n these severe temperatures we tend to find our hunger is affected, which can further lead to calorie deficit, which in turn can worsen the symptoms of exhaustion.</span></p><p><span>"When it’s hot we feel we need to eat less and in the cold we want to eat more to feel warm and function."</span></p><p>As though the celebs didn't have enough to worry about with all the creepy crawlies, now they'd better keep half an eye on what they're consuming too.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25054424><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Ant and Dec prepare for I'm A Celeb comeback as they arrive in Wales for new series" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25054424><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article20929800.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS199162195.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25053988.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Ant-and-Dec.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25054424>Ant and Dec prepare for I'm A Celeb comeback as they arrive in Wales for new series</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25054110><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Channel 4's Derry Girls ending after series 3 as creator says show was an 'honour'" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25054110><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article20897514.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-December-2004.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25054143.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_ARP_MDG_230921Derry_Girls_42779JPG.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25054110>Channel 4's Derry Girls ending after series 3 as creator says show was an 'honour'</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLauecKeo56ao2Kvtr%2FHrayco5WnerW%2ByJqjrGWWpLyleZFuZ29paWV%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
