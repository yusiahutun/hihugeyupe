The Colts didn’t need to jockey for a quarterback in this draft after trading with the Eagles for Carson Wentz earlier this offseason."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They did get a potential understudy, however, adding Texas QB Sam Ehlinger in the sixth round.</p><p>Learn more about the Colts’ draft selections after every pick on this page:</p><p><strong>ROUND 1</strong></p><h3>No. 21: Kwity Paye, edge, Michigan</h3><p><strong>Stephen Holder’s analysis</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paye gives Colts’ defense extra juice</a></p><p><strong>Zak Keefer’s analysis:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade-loving Colts couldn’t be swayed from taking Michigan’s Kwity Paye</a></p><p><strong>Austin Meek’s analysis:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What the Colts are getting in Kwity Paye</a></p><p><strong>Dane Brugler’s analysis</strong>: Chris Ballard prioritizes athletic traits and football character. And with a need at pass rusher, Paye was an ideal fit. Several teams had Paye as the top pass rusher on their board, so the Colts had to feel good about him still being available here. His stat sheet wasn’t great in college, but he wasn’t allowed to just pin his ears back and go so I expect his pressure production to increase at the NFL level.</p><p><strong>Sheil Kapadia’s grade</strong>: <strong>B</strong></p><p>Sometimes, teams get lucky and need aligns with how players go off the board. That’s what happened with the Colts and Paye.</p><p>At 6-foot-3, 261 pounds, Paye is an explosive edge defender with tremendous athleticism and upside. He was a two-year starter with the Wolverines, and though he played well, his overall production (11.5 sacks in 38 games) was somewhat underwhelming. Given his athletic profile, it’s possible that Paye will be a more impactful player with the Colts than he was at Michigan. He’s a high-floor player with a big-time motor, and Paye will fit well as a prototypical defensive end in the Colts’ 4-3 scheme.</p><p><strong>ROUND 2</strong></p><h3>No. 54: Dayo Odeyingbo, DE, Vanderbilt</h3><p><strong>Zak Keefer’s analysis:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Ballard doubles down on pass rush</a></p><p><strong>Dane Brugler’s analysis</strong>: Odeyingbo entered the draft process as a top-50 prospect before he, unfortunately, suffered a torn Achilles before the Senior Bowl. The injury will sideline him for a chunk of the 2021 season, but the talent is there and Chris Ballard loves the value on a player with his immense talent. Odeyingbo can play inside or outside and the Colts are clearly committed to upgrading the defensive line with him and Paye.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Sheil Kapadia’s grade</strong>: <strong>C-</strong></p><p>Odeyingbo (6-foot-5, 285) was a productive college player with 12 sacks and 31 tackles for loss. But he tore his Achilles tendon in January. That’s a serious injury. It could mean that Odeyingbo doesn’t play in 2021, and there are no guarantees that he looks like the same player when he does return.</p><p>The Colts could be rewarded if Odeyingbo eventually reaches his upside. But this is a puzzling gamble so early in the draft.</p><p><strong>ROUND 3</strong></p><p>none</p><p><strong>ROUND 4</strong></p><h3>No. 127: Kylen Granson, TE, SMU</h3><p><strong>Zak Keefer’s analysis: </strong>He’s the first tight end Chris Ballard’s drafted in five years in Indy. Lots to like from Granson as a wide receiver/TE hybrid — we know Frank Reich loves this — but the biggest knocks are his drops. Reich’s on record saying he can live with the occasional drop if the big plays are there. (Think Ebron in 2018)</p><p><strong>Dane Brugler’s analysis:</strong> Granson might not be a game-breaker, but he displays a savvy feel in the passing game due to his athleticism (before and after the catch) and ability to track the ball outside his frame. He looks more like an oversized wideout than a traditional tight end and will struggle to create movement or control the point of attack as a blocker. Overall, Granson will need a hybrid role to see consistent offensive snaps in the NFL, but his athletic receiving skills and versatility are an intriguing combination for an NFL H-back.</p><p><strong>ROUND 5</strong></p><h3>No. 165: Shawn Davis, S, Florida</h3><p><strong>Stephen Holder’s analysis:</strong> The Colts have drafted a safety five of the past six years. Some hits and some misses, but they’ve found productive players like Julian Blackmon, Khari Willis and Clayton Geathers in the middle rounds. We will see whether fifth-rounder Shawn Davis can now join that group.</p><p><strong>Dane Brugler’s analysis:</strong> With his range and football IQ, Davis casts a wide net and senses what is about to happen, covering ground versus both the pass and the run. He has a cornerback background and shows a good feel for the game, but he is quicker than fast and will struggle against size and speed at the NFL level. Overall, Davis needs to clean up some of his issues to better mask his shortcomings, but he is a quick-twitch athlete with the awareness and urgency to compete for a nickel role as an NFL rookie (if he stays off the injury report).</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>ROUND 6</strong></p><h3>No. 218: Sam Ehlinger, QB, Texas</h3><p><strong>Stephen Holder’s analysis:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ehlinger offers another option behind Carson Wentz</a></p><p><strong>Max Olson’s analysis:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What the Colts are getting in Sam Ehlinger</a></p><p><strong>Dane Brugler’s analysis:</strong> The term “gamer” tends to be overused for tough-yet-flawed quarterbacks, but it sums up Ehlinger perfectly — it felt like the Longhorns always had a shot in close games because of his gutsy, resilient spirit and versatile skill set. As a passer, he has an adequate arm, but is often tardy with his decisions and needs to see things quicker if he is going to make plays through the air in the NFL. Overall, Ehlinger is not an anticipation thrower and his pocket presence leaves a lot to be desired, but his competitive toughness and dual-threat ability give him a chance to be a backup, similar in ways to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jalen Hurts</a>’ evaluation in the 2020 draft.</p><p><strong>Scout’s take on Ehlinger to Bob McGinn:</strong> “You could honestly probably play him at running back,” said one scout. “He’s tough enough that he’s played special teams. You want this kid on your team. He’s very genuine. The reason you’d be giving him a chance is because of who he is.”</p><p><strong>ROUND 7</strong></p><h3>No. 229: Mike Strachan, WR, Charleston</h3><p><strong>Dane Brugler’s analysis:</strong> Strachan looked like the Division II version of Chase Claypool on tape with his acceleration, ball-tracking skills and humongous catch radius to climb the ladder or snatch away from his frame. He won’t be able to physically dominate with his size/speed alone in the NFL, but he will benefit from not having another sport to focus on in the offseason for the first time in his life. Overall, Strachan will require development time before he is ready for the jump in talent at the pro level, but the athletic traits, body control and tracking skills for a player that size are uncommon and worth the Day 3 investment.</p><h3>No. 248: Will Fries, OL, Penn State</h3><p><strong>Dane Brugler’s analysis:</strong> Fries wins with technical savvy with his hands and eyes to control the point of attack, but he is more strong than powerful. Although most of his college experience came at tackle (35 starts) compared to guard (seven starts), his skill set projects much better inside. Overall, Fries is an alert blocker who understands fundamentals and landmarks, but his inconsistent timing and lack of explosiveness will be highlighted vs. NFL-level speed. He projects as a potential backup at guard.</p><p>Keep up with&nbsp;The Athletic’s&nbsp;latest NFL Draft coverage:</p><p><strong>LIVE BLOG:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The latest from the NFL Draft</a><br><strong>ROUND 2-3 PICK BY PICK:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dane Brugler’s analysis</a><br><strong>DRAFT GRADES:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheil Kapadia’s report cards</a><br><strong>BIG BOARD:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best available players remaining</a><br><strong>ROUND 1:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brugler’s analysis</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kapadia’s grades</a></p><p>(Photo of Sam Ehlinger: Tim Warner / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57kW5samhja3xzfJFqZmltX2V%2BcLXNnaCappGlvK210maaqKSkqHpzfJFqZKeenGKxs63FrWSpoZOgwG631qKrsmWglsamecWiq2afopaxpnnAp5tmq5OkwrW1zaBkq52gpL%2B1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
