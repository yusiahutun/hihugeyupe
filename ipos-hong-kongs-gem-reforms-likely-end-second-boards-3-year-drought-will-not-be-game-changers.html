HKEX, which runs the third-largest stock market in Asia, also reduced the lock-up period for major shareholders disposing of their controlling stakes from 24 months to 12 months. GEM does not have a profit requirement, while the main board requires a company to make at least HK$80 million in the three years leading to its listing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">GEM, formerly known as Growth Enterprise Market, was established in 1999 to make room for companies that did not meet the tougher main board requirements. It has 328 listings with a combined market capitalisation of HK$54 billion as of Monday, or 0.2 per cent of the total stock market.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong’s first IPO of 2024 makes a weak trading debut as RoboSense shares drop</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In comparison, the main board has 2,283 listed companies with a combined market capitalisation of HK$30.2 trillion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The new rules will help to increase the interest of companies wanting to list on the GEM board in the longer term, particularly the streamlined transfer process to the main board,” said Stephen Chan, a corporate and securities partner of international legal firm Dechert. In the nearer term, however, improving the GEM’s fortunes will depend on broader market sentiment, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, agreed the reforms have not gone far enough, especially amid current conditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While the market sentiment towards the main board is poor, investors will not pay attention to GEM companies,” Wen said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The value of IPOs on Hong Kong’s main board last year fell 53.5 per cent to a 20-year low of US$5.9 billion from 68 listings, according to Refinitiv.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s Anta eyes boost from Finland unit Amer’s US$1 billion New York IPO</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The main board dropped to eighth last year in the global IPO table, the lowest since 2001 when it ranked 14th, according to Refinitiv data. It stood third in 2022 and last took the top spot in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This market will not fully recover unless there is a change in the regulatory framework, where smaller companies and growth companies are actually welcomed and their listing applications dealt with efficiently,” said Arnold Ip, chairman of the Association of Hong Kong Capital Market Practitioners, in an interview with the Post in November.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ip said high fundraising costs, a long vetting process and uncertainties about approvals had ­discouraged companies from undertaking listings on GEM, while he said the current reforms had not addressed these problems.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYmmEd3%2BWaKCpp6NitbC6xmaiqKaXqHqoscxmqZ6en6e6tHnLoqKepKlisq%2BwjKycnKeemXqju8Crm6xlY2LGpq3RZpurp6WctbV51qKjpWWepMFursRmnpqllWKwqa3NoJyrqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
