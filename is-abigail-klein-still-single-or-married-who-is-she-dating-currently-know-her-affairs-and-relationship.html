After the break-up, her love interest was a football player, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Troy Aikman</strong> </a>in 2012 who&nbsp;is a former American football quarterback for the <strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong> in the National Football League.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/11/having-previously-dated-troy-aikman-and-tanner-beard-is-abigail-klein-currently-single.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Abigail Klein, Tanner Beard, and Troy Aikman.</strong></p><p>Troy and Abigail are former colleagues and were photographed together at an upscale Los Angeles eatery, Boa.
