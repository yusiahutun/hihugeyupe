He made his first significant film appearance in the 1999 movie, “The Basket.” Dane has gone on to be featured in many films and TV shows, the most popular being his role as Dr. Mark Sloan or McSteamy in the world-famous TV series, “Grey’s Anatomy,” which he played for over ten years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mark-sloan-baby.jpg><p>The “American Carnage” star remains an active actor to this day. He is estimated to have a net worth of about $7 million. He is rumored to have a lot of upcoming projects, such as “Borderline,” “Dangerous Waters,” and “Into the Beautiful.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Eric_Dane_Gay></span>Is Eric Dane Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Regardless of all the rumors, Eric Dane is not gay. The actor has mentioned that he is a straight man on multiple occasions. He has been married before to a woman, Rebecca Gayhea, and has never been proven to be romantically involved with a man.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rebecca_Gayheart></span>Rebecca Gayheart<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><a href=#>Rebecca Gayheart</a> (born August 12, 1971) is an American actress and model. She started acting early at age 15 and featured in fellow Hollywood star Bret Ratner’s short film, “New York University.” The two stars began dating and even got engaged till they called it off in 1999.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rebecca-1024x1024.jpg><p>On October 29, 2004, Rebecca married Eric Dane after dating him for about eight months. They have two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rebbeca-and-kids-1024x1024.jpg><p>Dane and Rebecca made headlines when a<a href=#> video</a> of them naked and allegedly on drugs in the shower with fellow actress Kari Ann Peniche leaked online. Shortly after, Rebecca filed for divorce in 2018, citing “irreconcilable differences. Reports indicate that the star of “Redeeming Love” is single.</p><p>Despite his marriage to Rebecca, people have questioned the actor’s sexuality multiple times, and it remains unclear whether these queries stem from the gay character he portrays in HBO’s “Euphoria” or the humorous post by KJ Apa.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Eric_Dane_and_KJ_Apa_Dating></span>Are Eric Dane and KJ Apa Dating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The internet went into a frenzy when famous “Riverdale” star KJ Apa took to Instagram to share a photo of him and Dane lying on a bed together with the caption: “New couple alert!” while they were on set for their upcoming movie “One Fast Move.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kj.jpg><p>It was pretty clear that the post was a joke as KJ was dating model Clara Berry with whom he shares a son. Unfortunately, fans did not take it that way. Observers swiftly drew parallels between the photo and Dane’s Euphoria character. They removed the post shortly afterward.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Eric_Danes_Character_in_Euphoria></span>Who Is Eric Dane’s Character in Euphoria?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dane plays a pansexual/gay character Cal Jacobs in HBO’s award-winning TV Show, “Euphoria,” featuring Hollywood’s <a href=#>Zendaya</a> as the lead actress. His character portrays a predatory and closeted queer man who frequently engages in extra-marital relationships with younger gay men and Trans women. His character also films their sex hookups without their consent.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, Dane was 49 while KJ was 25 years so understandably, this contributed to the uproar after KJ’s post as fans emphasized the age difference between the two. The fever did not affect both stars as they continued to film their movie in Atlanta, Georgia. Fans now view and accept their ‘bromance’ as a regular occurrence.</p><p>On several occasions, interviewers have questioned the actor about his feelings regarding his “Euphoria” character, and he has frequently expressed his honor in portraying Cal. As a straight man playing a gay role, he believes it gives him a voice for the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>In his own words: “The gay community has been super supportive. I think I’ve lent them a voice in portraying this character. I hope everything I do is sincere because I wouldn’t want to misrepresent something important.”</p><p>While speculation may persist, Eric Dane is not gay. The “Private Practice” actor prioritizes advancing his career and spending time with his family, and he remains a vocal supporter of the LGBTQ+ community.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5xKugnGWUlrumecaasGaZXaG8sLeMoqWtp12dtrR50p6vrpmcnsG6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
