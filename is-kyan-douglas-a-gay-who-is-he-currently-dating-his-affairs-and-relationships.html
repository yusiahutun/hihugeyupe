They got engaged in June and tried to give the relationship a chance but as before, it did not work out and they eventually called off their engagement just a month later in July of 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>The man was out of the limelight for his relationship for almost 4 years. However, in 2010, rumors claimed that he was dating American singer, dancer, and actor <strong>James Lance Bass,</strong> who is also an openly gay man.</p><p><img alt="Kyan Douglas and rumored boyfriend James Lance Bass" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Kyan%20Douglas%20and%20Lance%20Bass.jpg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kyan Douglas and rumored boyfriend James Lance Bass</p><p>According to reports, the two started dating after Lance did a lot of research and finally came to a conclusion that he was a nice man.&nbsp;</p><p>One of his friends said, 'Lance admitted to having a bad track record with friends and asked everyone what they thought of Kyan.&nbsp;We all assured him Kyan is 'good people.'</p><p>Despite so many rumors and claims, neither of the two openly spoke about it.
