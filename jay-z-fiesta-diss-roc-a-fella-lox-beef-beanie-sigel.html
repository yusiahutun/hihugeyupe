The tension between the two collectives made their beef one of the most memorable at the time, with all the lyrical jabs and disses that were hurled back in forth.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>For years there has been speculation as to what caused the two factions to go to war with no clear story. However, Beanie Sigel has given his side of how things went south between the crews.</p><p>According to the State Property co-founder, The LOX were firing subtle shots at the Roc-A-Fella team on a variety of tracks. But it all apparently began after Hov jumped on the remix of R. Kelly’s “Fiesta,” the original of which <a href=#>Jadakiss</a> appeared on.</p><p>Jay’s verse on the track had The LOX feeling like he was attacking Jadakiss on the low, and before long, the war began.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Kiss had that record. He was on that R. Kelly record,” Beans said about the original “Fiesta” track. “He didn’t take a shot at me. Jay took a shot at them. ‘After the party it’s the hotel lobby … and after the original it’s probably this.’ That ‘Fiesta’ joint. Kiss and them was on that joint first.”</p><p>He continued: “It was a shot because it was a couple joints that they was on first and Jay jumped on joints and then you hear little stuff. We all know who the best is Big ain’t here so it was a lot of dark storm.”</p><p></p><p>Styles P spoke about the origins of the beef during his visit to Math Hoffa’s My Expert Opinion podcast and <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>spoke of a similar story of Hov hopping on songs that Kiss and The LOX already did</a>.</p><p>“Beans was like us but from Philly,” Styles said. “You already know what Hov and Dame and them were doing, so that was more personal for me. Kiss and Hov kept being on the same remixes and something happened. It just felt like they were aiming at Kiss for me. Kiss is our Derek Jeter. Where we from, you fuck with one of us, you fuck with everybody.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Sheek Louch echoed a similar sentiment in 2017 in an interview with DJ Whoo Kid.</p><p>“Beans and them were saying some shit lyrically because they were slick-talking,” he said. “Them Philly n-ggas they be saying some shit. So that’s where I’d be like, ‘Oh shit, Styles get the guns! Where the fuck them n-ggas record at?’ Like it was that kind of situation.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/12/styles-p-recalls-wanting-to-shoot-jay-z-and-beanie-sigel-250x142.png alt="Styles P Recalls Wanting To Shoot JAY-Z & Beanie Sigel During LOX/Roc-A-Fella Beef" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Styles P Recalls Wanting To Shoot JAY-Z & Beanie Sigel During LOX/Roc-A-Fella Beef</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 8, 2022</p></a><p><a href=# rel=noopener>State Property member Freeway also recalled the beef during his conversation with VLAD TV</a> and said something similar regarding subtle shots being thrown around. According to Freeway, the beef started with&nbsp;slight disses exchanged&nbsp;between&nbsp;Jadakiss and Beanie, which resulted in The LOX member’s diss track&nbsp;“Un-Hunh!”</p><p>“When we heard that, we knew that’s what it was,” Freeway recalled.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The beef hit its peak when Beans and Kiss grabbed the reins and went at each other on various diss tracks. Things nearly got violent as members of both crews carried guns and made frequent threats.</p><p>Cooler heads prevailed, though, as <a href=# rel=noopener>Beanie Sigel and Jadakiss squashed their beef during a meetup at Riverside Park in New York City in August 2001</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mihmrFdr3qntcSsq5pllJ7AtHnRqJpmmV2bsq24wGajqLBdl7KmsoybnJqmmZp6tLXGnqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
