Jelena is characterized by her highly aggressive playing style, which is characterized by powerful inside-out groundstrokes and a tendency to aim for the lines, playing with unsurpassed confidence and using her backhand as her strongest weapon.</p><h2><strong>Jelena Ostapenko Biography</strong></h2><p>The 2017 French Open champion was born on June 8, 1997, in Riga, the capital and largest city of Lativa. Her birth name is Jelena Ostapenko. However, her parents would have liked to give their beloved daughter another nickname, Alona, an ethnic Ukrainian name. Since she is Latvian, the children’s naming follows the custom of choosing a name that appears in the Latvian naming calendar, so Alona was outvoted and Jelena was chosen instead. Nevertheless, she is known as Alona to her family and friends and a number of fans, and a part of the sports community.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Eric Gordon Wife, Girlfriend, Brother, Height, Salary, Bio, Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>Her preferred nickname Alona is being considered by the Latvian government to be included in the Latvian naming calendar after her victory at the French Open.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jelena-Ostapenko.jpg><p>Jelena was born in an athletic home, her mother is a tennis coach, her father played professional football in a Ukrainian club.

Besides playing tennis, she also started dancing at the same age and was a professional ballroom dancer for seven years. She took part in the Latvian National Ballroom Dance Championships and could dance about 10 dances.</p><p>After juggling with both activities until she was 12 years old, the time had finally come for her to make a choice. Jelena chose tennis instead of dance, which she believes is important to her and has brought better results.
