Jennifer Garner wanted to take advantage of the larger foyer in the home she's currently renting with her kids, but things quickly got out of hand when it came to the family Christmas tree.
The &#34;Peppermint&#34; actress broke it all down in a hilarious video wherein she revealed that she's not sure she got the right tree delivered to her house."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But she wasn't done yet.</p><p>"But then it was delivered and I'm not sure this was the tree we picked out," she continued as the camera zoomed out to show an evergreen absolutely towering over Jennifer, and at 5'8" she's not exactly petite.</p><p>"It's a little aggressive," she laughed as she looked up at its towering height. It looks like the family philosophy this holiday season was to go big and go home!</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:985fa337-4f85-5e9a-8baf-44d8375be210 data-container-ref=toofab:article:58f7206a-1bd5-5223-812b-3336a41338a2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/38/5by4/2019/04/24/38b98f1f4af35401854f7fb606c85cf2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Jennifer Garner Won't Read This Article</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As obnoxious as the tree might look, it's also rather stunning and we imagine she and her kids will have an absolute blast decorating it. They may have to go back out to the store to get more decorations to cover it fully (and maybe an extendable ladder to reach the top), but it should be something truly magical when they're finished.</p><p>And perhaps more importantly, this will be a memory those kids will cherish for years to come. The danger for Jennifer, though, is if they decide that big trees is where it's at and the kids simply refuse to accept anything smaller than a tree at least twice mom's height in the future.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
