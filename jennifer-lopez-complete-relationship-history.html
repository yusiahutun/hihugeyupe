Just a few months after they separated, they worked together as judges on dance competition series Q’Viva! The Chosen. In 2016, they released a cover of “Olvídame y Pega la Vuelta,” which they performed together at the Latin Grammys later that year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Honestly, we’re always gonna be great friends.
