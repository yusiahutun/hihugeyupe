Jeremy Allen White rose to fame when he starred as Lip Gallagher in the Showtime drama-comedy Shameless. He stayed on the show from when he was 18 til the finale when he was 30. His next role is dominating our feeds (and hearts) as the emotionally frayed and unavailable chef Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With the new Wonka movie starring Timothée Chalamet released at the same time, and Gene starring as the titular role in the OG 1971 film Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, the comparison is on everyone’s minds.</p><p>Without further ado, here’s if Jeremy Allen White and Gene Wilder are related.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jeremy-allen-white.png><p>Are Jeremy Allen White and Gene Wilder related? No, Jeremy Allen White and Gene Wilder are not related at all. In the <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLH4mPd_lsk" rel=nofollow>Buzzfeed Puppy Interview</a> (awwww, by the way), Jeremy clears up the fact. “I’m not related to Gene Wilder,” the actor said. “I think a lot of people think I am.” Iron Claw co-star Zac Efron reacted, “That’s hilarious, I can kind of see it.”</p><p>Though this isn’t the first time Jeremy’s been asked the question. In an<a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxxG_AoRTlo&t=166s" rel=nofollow> Instyle video,</a> he said, “Everyone’s decided I look a lot like Gene Wilder, which I agree.” He pointed out a meme that said that his The Bear character Carmy was a “ketamine Gene Wilder” which he thought was “was weird and funny.”</p><p>&nbsp;In another GQ video, Jeremy <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pDLGMSXXSw" rel=nofollow>answered the question </a>again and said that he would “take a comparison any day.” The interviewer later pushed, “Are you… Gene Wilder?” Jeremy then joked, “I&nbsp;am&nbsp;actually<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Gene Wilder.”</p><p>Seth Meyers even <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEGxtcCRbiY">asked the question</a> because he’s been getting a clickbait article with the headline “These Celebrity Grandchildren Look Exactly Like Their Grandparents” with a comparison photo of Gene and Jeremy. The Late Night With Seth Meyers host asked if he’s ever clicked on it, and he said “No, I haven’t. Because I know that’s not my grandfather.” He later revealed that he first got the comparison after the first season of The Bear, and gushed over his love for the late actor, “I love him so much. The first movie that I watched over and over was Young Frankenstein.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
