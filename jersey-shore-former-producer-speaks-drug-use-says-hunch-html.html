The cast filmed season 2 in Miami.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_43>“Miami is obviously a big drug city,” the source told the outlet. “When this cast member [wanted] to score, it wasn’t hard. The cast members are veterans by now, and they know how to get rid of the cameras when they want to.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_29>The outlet claimed to know which&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore&nbsp;roommate</a> the source was talking about but did not disclose the information. Allegedly, MTV was unaware of any drug use in the house.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Jersey Shore’ producer says they ‘had a hunch’ but never proof of drug use</h2><p id=par-7_44>In a Reddit thread from March 2020, a former story and field producer for&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore&nbsp;Seasons 1 and 2</a> hosted an Ask Me Anything. “Were the crew, production, etc., aware of how much drugs were being taken and just turn a blind eye?” a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan asked</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_12>“We had a hunch but never any solid proof,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">producer replied</a>, adding:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“Nobody turned a blind eye to that because it’s such a huge liability. Sadly, business trumps morality. Nobody probably cared they were doing drugs because of it being such a toxic habit. We cared because it could potentially threaten the cash cow.”</p><h2 id=h-jenni-jwoww-farley-opens-up-about-her-drug-use-in-italy>Jenni ‘JWoww’ Farley opens up about her drug use in Italy&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-9_34>Like Sorrentino, Jenni “JWoww” Farley has been open about her experience with drug abuse. In an episode of&nbsp;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Farley talks about the miscarriage she experienced before filming began for&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore’s&nbsp;Italy season</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_55>“Right before Italy, like three or four weeks before Italy, my grandmother passed,” Farley tells Sorrentino in the&nbsp;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation&nbsp;episode. “Me and Roger [Mathews] actually lost a baby, like I ended up pregnant. Not a lot of people know. And they put me on medication because of it, because I, like, couldn’t handle life.”</p><p id=par-11_45>As Farley explains in the episode, she was on Xanax after the miscarriage. “It would take me down, like downers; it was making me so groggy,” she adds. “Then I started taking uppers with it, segue right into Italy. I was a f—ing mess.”</p><p id=par-12_23>Today, Farley and her ex-husband have two children: Meilani and Greyson. Both Jersey Shore stars are in a happy and healthy place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3pr7SnrBmq5ikv6Z5xaippp2iYr2zu8Oump6qXai9pq3KrGSdqqWcera%2FxGaqmrGjYrW2usKhZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
