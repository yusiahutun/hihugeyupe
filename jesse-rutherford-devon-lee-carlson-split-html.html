Her boyfriend, Jesse Rutherford, is ten years older than Eilish. He was born on 21 August 1991 in&nbsp;Newbury Park, California, U.S. He is 31 years old as of writing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Billie Eilish and boyfriend Jesse Rutherford’s age gap is controversial?</h2><p>Billie Eilish and Born to Blonde star Jesse Rutherford’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">age gap has also brought them controversies</a>. Eilish brother, Finneas, has had to defend his sister’s relationship with her boyfriend, Jesse.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, Eilish and The Neighbourhood singer Jesse remain unbothered about their age gap. Even when the duo sparked dating rumors in October 2022 after they were spotted publicly involved in<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> PDAs</a> together, either holding hands, having dinner, or kissing, they started facing criticisms online due to their age. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mainly on Twitter and TikTok, many jumped&nbsp;on the bandwagon of ridiculing the <a href=# rel=follow>Happier Than Ever</a> singer and&nbsp;Jesse’s 10-year age difference after their relationship went official.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>One fan on Twitter wrote, “Jesse Rutherford is too old for Billie Eilish and it is made worse by the fact that he met her when she was barely 16.” Another user tweeted, “When she’s 30 she’s gonna look back at this and see exactly what we’re all seeing now.”</p><p>Another reason why many fans were furious over Eilish and Rutherford’s age difference also had to do with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lyrics from one of Rutherford’s old songs</a>&nbsp;from 2015 titled ‘Single,’ which seemingly tells a story of an adult dating a young girl. Here are the most controversial&nbsp;parts of the song for your reference.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I don’t know if we should be alone together/ I still got a crush, that’s obvious/ If nobody’s around, what’s stopping us?<br>Just a baby, but she’s growing up so fast/ And I’m allergic to the waiting/ She’s just a baby girl/ And I love to watch her dance/ But it’s making me go crazy.</p><p>And at the time of the song, Rutherford, then 24 years old, was in the first year of dating Devon Lee Carlson, 21, who was also featured&nbsp;in the song's video. The song might have been a reference to the time when they met in high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Moving forward, Billie Eilish and Jesse Rutherford were first spotted holding hands at Horror Nights in Los Angelos. Later, they also faced criticism when they were snapped in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Halloween-themed costume</a> pictures in which&nbsp;Eilish was seen donning a baby costume, whereas Rutherford dressed up as an aged man. The couple was likely making fun of their long age difference in a lighthearted manner, which some thought “disturbing.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the pair&nbsp;pulling off the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram picture</a>, sarcastically representing their relationship, with Eilish and Rutherford dressing up in the baby-old man theme, proved they were committed to their relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Truly, the pair has risen above never-ending criticism, and according to Eilish, who usually doesn’t bother to speak about her personal life unless there’s a sense of exclusivity, she is inspired by her boyfriend, Jesse Rutherford, who had been her crush for years.&nbsp;</p><p>“I managed to get my way to a point in my life where I not only was known by a person that I thought was the hottest f**king f**ker alive, but pulled his ass! Are you kidding me? Can we just [get a] round of applause for me? I pulled his ass! All me! I did that s**t! I locked that motherf**ker down!,” Eilish commanded, talking with Vanity Fair.</p><p>“I’m really inspired by this person and you know he’s inspired by me, it’s really cool,” the famous songstress added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The pair had known each other since 2017 when Eilish was only 15. Eilish has described meeting him for the first time as “crazy.”&nbsp;“I love him so much, oh my god. He’s so good, bro,” she shared with NME.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>&nbsp;And if you didn’t know, Eilish’s first concert was that of The Neighbourhood, which took place at The Shrine in 2015.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Is Jesse Rutherford Married? Does he have an ex-wife?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Alt-rock singer Rutherford hasn’t been married yet, but he has had prior dating relationships with the likes of Anabel Englund and Devon Lee Carlson before Billie Eilish.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Who was Jesse Rutherford dating in the past?

After dating for over six years, the couple separated and went different ways in 2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Jesse Rutherford and Devon Lee Carlson posing for a picture.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Devon</a> confirmed their break up on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Call Her Daddy</a> podcast in September 2022. However, as per reports, the couple parted ways in November 2021 after being together for six years.&nbsp;Here is everything we know about their split.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Previously, Rutherford was in an on-again-off-again relationship with singer Anabel Englund before their breakup in 2014. Born on 1 September 1991 in New York City, Englund is best known for her collaborations with&nbsp;electronic and house music artists such as Hot Natured and MK.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Why did Jesse Rutherford and Devon Lee Carlson break up?</h2><p>The rumors of their alleged breakup started in November 2021 after fans and followers noted Carlson had changed her TikTok bio. It previously read “Jesse’s girlfriend,” but at the time, it said, “no bio yet.”</p><p>Many of her fans questioned it on Carlson’s TikToks, but the latter did not respond to any of them. Around the same time, Rutherford also deleted all posts on his Instagram and unfollowed everyone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He used to have a lot of pictures of his then-girlfriend; again, at the time, there were none of it. To make matters worse, Carlson also deleted some photos and videos of the singer from her feed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Devon Lee Carlson’s TikTok bio fueled breakup rumors.&nbsp;</strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok</a>)</p><p>The latest post she had of the pair was from 21 August 2021, posted on the occasion of Rutherford’s birthday.&nbsp;</p><p>After such a fiasco, fans began snooping around to see if the couple had split or if they were keeping their relationship lowkey.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>&nbsp;Did Chip Chrome Cause Jesse Rutherford and Devon Lee Carlson’s Break Up?</a></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Setting Fashion Couple Goals Comes Naturally to Jesse Rutherford and Devon Lee Carlson</a></p><p>Carlson’s comment section was flooded with questions about her and Rutherford’s split. Then, in December 2021, she uploaded a video of cleaning behind her dog, Marty.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>There she lip-synced&nbsp;to the sound that went, “I don’t know him, so I can’t comment on anyone I don’t know.

The song refers to a bad breakup, so Carlson could have referred to it. Later, she told the&nbsp;Call Her Daddy podcast,&nbsp;“We had the most mutual breakup ever.”</p><p>Later, Deven Lee Carlson <a href=# rel="follow noopener">reportedly started dating actor Duke Nicholson</a>.
