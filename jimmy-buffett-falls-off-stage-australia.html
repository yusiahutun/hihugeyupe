"No one really wanted to leave because everyone was anxious to know if he survived the fall. Everyone was pretty horrified," he tells <a href=#>ABC</a>. "We were in the 10th row and it looked like he did a massive face plant after his encore and pretty much didn't get up ... We were told to leave the premises."</p><p>Buffett was performing his last night of three back-to-back sold out shows at the Sydney Opera House when the incident occurred -- his first performances down under in 20 years. He is scheduled to perform in New Zealand on Saturday, and is said to be in stable condition now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo6GdosZurtSfnZ6spGKzorjLrGSonpZiwLWtxp5kmq2jqb%2BiuMiaZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
