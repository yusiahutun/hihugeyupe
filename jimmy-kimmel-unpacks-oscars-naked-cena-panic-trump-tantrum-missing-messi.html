Eventually, though, the <a href=#><strong>Oscars</strong></a> host made his way back to his own studio to unpack the previous night's antics.</p><p>The bulk of Kimmel's monologue was about Sunday night's Oscars television, which somehow both started five minutes early and then had extra time at the end.

"There were meeting and side meetings and emails and texts and phone calls. There were people sweating, somebody was crying."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>John Cena takes the <a href=#>#Oscars</a> stage nude to present Best Costume Design <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SeX9xL9QHK</a></p>— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) <a href=#>March 11, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@DEADLINE</a><p>"Then, once they realized we weren't going to take no for an answer, there were intense discussions about the envelope, whether we needed to Velcro it to John's body," Kimmel continued. He even showed the massive envelope he claims producers wanted to use instead of the standard-sized one that made it to air.</p><p>Rob Mills, the executive vice president of unscripted and alternative entertainment at Walt Disney Television, talked with <a href=#><strong>Variety</strong></a> about the lengths they had to go to get this segment through the network's S&P.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:60e7f0ef-5eb6-4ca7-bc1e-8c406c6bf6fd data-container-ref=toofab:article:19427442-2d25-455f-a33d-6ec2513918e5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/06/5by4/2024/03/11/068908805b844996b4eb0412a81ed924_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Oscars 2024: All the Most Viral Moments of the Night</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I’m going to educate you a little here," Mills told the outlet about the expectations. "A bulge cannot be showing, and you can’t show crack. It was also, ’What happens if he drops that card?’ So, we made sure that, for all intents and purposes, he looked like a Ken doll up front. His crack was covered in the back and then the envelope was Velcro-ed on there so it wouldn’t fall."</p><p>"But beyond that, he was naked."</p><p>That's how Kimmel's guest, <a href=#><strong>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</strong></a> found his fellow WWE Superstar backstage. He called it a "crazy moment," seeing "naked" Cena backstage. "You really missed an opportunity to promote Wrestlemania by attacking each other in that moment," Kimmel quipped.</p><p>"A half-naked John Cena isn't the guy who I want to attack in that moment," The Rock shot back. "I need him fully naked before I attack him."</p><p>One moment that wouldn't have happened had it not been for that extra time the show banked as it progressed was Kimmel reading from former president <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump's</strong></a> actual post trashing the show on Truth Social.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e185471d-e73e-4c19-a36b-743267a1b832 data-container-ref=toofab:article:19427442-2d25-455f-a33d-6ec2513918e5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e4/5by4/2024/02/16/e430ec28cabe420590c05491bd60f99b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Nearly One in Five Americans Believe Taylor Swift Election Conspiracy Theory, Poll Finds</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As it turns out, it might have not happened had Kimmel listened to his producer, Molly McNearney, who also happens to be an EP on Jimmy Kimmel Live! ... and Jimmy Kimmel's wife.</p><p>"I will tell you, I’m really not proud of this, but I tried to talk Jimmy out of reading that," she confessed to Variety. "I feel like my instincts are usually right, but I was totally off on that. I said, 'Please don't read this.' And he asked why. I said, 'I don't want to give Trump airtime in the Oscars. This is the one time we don't have to talk about him."</p><p>"My second thought was just the risk, like the show was going well! I just wanted to make sure it ended well, and I didn't want it to end on a sour note," she continued. "But he had a glimmer in his eye, and he said, 'I got this.' He really did. This is where he shines."</p><p>After coming up with the retort, "Isn't it past your jail time?" McNearney admitted that the joke killed in the room, and lamented, "I'm never going to win an argument in my household again."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Anatomy of a Fall" star Messi is in the audience at this year's <a href=#>#Oscars</a>. <a href=#>https://t.co/qxqSOgif3j</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Y0yuT4uLqF</a></p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href=#>March 10, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@Variety</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>New reaction vid just dropped, courtesy of Messi at the <a href=#>#Oscars2024</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/N1rJEAyZGd</a></p>— NEON (@neonrated) <a href=#>March 11, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@neonrated</a><p>One of the show's biggest highlights for fans at home was the appearances of Messi, the breakout dog star of Anatomy of a Fall. Fans at home got to see Messi twice during the broadcast, but it turns out he wasn't actually there live. And there's a good reason for that.</p><p>"Our plan was to have him sitting in the audience throughout the show, including my monologue," Kimmel recalled. There was just one problem. "We did a rehearsal, the dog was barking like crazy the whole time -- because he's a dog -- which was making it hard to tell jokes. It was really funny."</p><p>While they considered just going with it for the sheer random chaos and humor of it, Kimmel admitted it "wouldn't have been great for the 'In Memoriam' montage."</p><a id=gallery-link-29178204-9f46-45c2-a551-33c8c041d08d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:29178204-9f46-45c2-a551-33c8c041d08d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:19427442-2d25-455f-a33d-6ec2513918e5 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/07/4by3/2024/03/11/0713006606894ddf98486c41183d292c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmampfn7auudhmoqKlnZq5bsHNqZico6NivLSvwKuqZqaRoLKlecKepZploJa7qq%2BMramupaBiwaK606uspmWdnsC0tc2gZKado6i2cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
