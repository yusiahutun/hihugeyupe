Where are They Now?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-05-04</div><h2>Are Joey and Kelsey still together from The Bachelor Season 28?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Kelsey-A-Joey-Still-Together-Bachelor.jpg><p>Are Joey and Kelsey still together from The Bachelor 2024? The answer is yes. Joey Graziadei and Kelsey Anderson, also known as Kelsey A., are still together and engaged after The Bachelor Season 28, according to Reality Steve. Kelsey, a 25-year-old Junior Project Manager from Leesville, Louisiana, was the winner of The Bachelor Season 28.</p><p>Joey picked Kelsey as his Bachelor winner at the Final Rose Ceremony in The Bachelor Season 28 finale, where he gave her his final rose. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Joey also proposed to Kelsey, which she accepted, and the two got engaged. His runner-up was Daisy Kent, a 25-year-old Account Executive from Becker, Minnesota. Joey and Kelsey are still together after The Bachelor Season 28 finale, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>In an interview with People published after the finale aired, the couple said they want to take their time and enjoy their engagement rather than rushing into a wedding. “We want to <a rel=nofollow href=#>promise our lives together</a>, but we don’t want to rush it,” Joey said. “It’s time now to enjoy this. We have the rest of our lives to celebrate it. We’re going to take it day by day and just enjoy this time.”</p><p>Kelsey added that she predicts the engagement could last years. “I honestly don’t know what I want my wedding to look like,” she said. “I definitely want all my close friends and family there. I think I want a very timeless wedding, but where? Not sure. I guess we’re going to have to figure that out.”</p><p>For Joey’s engagement, it’s almost certain the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=#>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed that Joey picked Kelsey A. as his winner in February 2024. He originally reported that Daisy was Joey’s winner in January 2024, however, he later corrected himself when fans discovered that Joey and Kelsey A. were at what looked like the same house for what was believed to be a “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/BachelorNation/comments/1awdv5j/proof_of_joeys_recent_shv/>Safe House Visit</a>,” a term also known as a “Happy Couple Weekend” to describe a secret date set up by producers between the Bachelor and his winner before the finale airs. According to a Reddit thread by user @sandbetweenhertoes, TikToks that Joey and Kelsey A. posted showed them in houses with the exact same microwave, cabinets, and backyard, which fans believed was confirmation that they were on a “Happy Couple Weekend.”</p><p>In The Bachelor Season 28 finale, Daisy realizes that she wasn’t Joey’s winner during their last date and goes to Kelsey’s room to tell her essentially, “It’s not me, it’s you. I’m gonna tell him that tomorrow,” which was a first for Bachelor Nation, according to Reality Steve. “Once the final 3 rose ceremony happens and it’s down to two people, those two never interact with each other, whether it’s Bachelor or Bachelorette season. They don’t want them chatting each other up and what not. So Daisy must’ve made a plea to producers (or producers thought it’d be a ‘first’ for a storyline) to let a girl who thinks she’s not getting picked to go talk to the other girl,” Reality Steve wrote. “And that’s what they did.”</p><p>Reality Steve described Daisy and Kelsey A.’s conversation as “supportive” and “straightforward.” At the Final Rose Ceremony, Daisy arrives first and tells Joey what she told Kelsey A. and they had a positive breakup. The scene after his breakup with Daisy was shown in the first two minutes of The Bachelor Season 28 premiere, which showed Joey taking off his jacket and talking to producers before Kelsey A. arrives to decompress what Daisy told him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7ymxYyknKWrla56tMDIpaNmrJ%2BcsrW0xKtkm5mTnbKtu9Fo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
