Once they got to their room, Travolta used his favorite pick-up line, as the pilot explained:<br>“As we walked from the restaurant back to the room, John suddenly said, ‘Hey, would you like a massage?’ I’d already prepared myself for something like that, so I said, ‘Sure, why not? I went back to his room, showered and came out wearing only a towel. John said, ‘Okay, like down here on the bed.’ He gave me a massage – and it turned into something else!"<br>Unlike the stories we've all heard from the various lawsuits filed against Travolta, this relationship was definitely consensual! Gotterba continued:<br>“John was gentle, but very passionate. The next day, he told me with a big smile on his face, ‘I really enjoyed last night.’ And I told him, ‘So did I!”<br>All was well and good for years until Travolta met and married his current wife, Kelly Preston. Gotterba says the last time he hung out with his famous lover was in 1992 and explains:<br>“They’d just gotten back from the Church of Scientology’s Celebrity Center in Hollywood when I arrived and John asked me to go with him for a walk on the beach. We were making small talk when suddenly, I blurted out, ‘So, John, tell me. Now that you’re married, do you still prefer men – or women?’ He looked me straight in the eye and said, ‘Well, Doug, I still prefer men!' I said, ‘okay.’ And that’s the last time we saw each other.”<br>At least it was fun while it lasted. Gotterba is saying that Travolta couldn't get enough sexy time and even enjoyed multiple male partners at once! Oh yeah, and he wanted to make a sex tape!<br>If they did, we hope he's got that locked away in a safe deposit box somewhere because the jig's up once that bad boy gets leaked.<br>http://perezhilton.com/2012-08-29-john-travolta-gay-lover-doug-gotterba-tells-all/#comments<br>http://www.examiner.com/article/john-travolta-gay-lover-authoring-tell-all-book-claim</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZooaignmLBs63VqKOtmV2Wu6V5w6isoGWXpMG1sdGbmA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
