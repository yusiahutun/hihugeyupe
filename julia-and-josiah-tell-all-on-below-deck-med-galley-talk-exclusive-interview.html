Josiah Carter: I think for me, it's really hard to be full-time, because you'll be away for potentially 10 months of the year — away from family and friends, and I really enjoy a nice big bed, and my own space. But yeah, so I'd absolutely do a season here, a season there."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Are you going to reenter the full-time yacht life?</strong></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Josiah Carter:</strong> I think for me, it's really hard to be full-time, because you'll be away for potentially 10 months of the year — away from family and friends, and I really enjoy a nice big bed, and my own space. But yeah, so I'd absolutely do a season here, a season there. Absolutely. I really enjoy it. For me, it's such a fun thing to do. It's very tiring and it's very time consuming ... but the rewards are great. You're away from your family and your friends, but you get to go to these amazing places. So yeah, I'm going to keep going on yachting for a few more years, see how I feel. And yeah, just go from there, really.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Great. Well, Julia, you've left the yacht life behind, largely. Your entrepreneurship with Myrtle & Maude, it seems to be going great. What do you think the pros and cons are of having left yacht life and remade yourself as a small business owner?</strong></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Julia d'Albert Pusey:</strong> Yeah. Do you know what? It's a weird one, when you work in yachting. I was never fully committed to yachting, where I had a long career in it. I was very much — I dipped in and out. But I do find that people find the transition quite hard. And it is quite hard, it's just such a different lifestyle, to being on land [compared] to on sea. So I know people do find that quite difficult.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>But yet, I've got husband, I've got a dog now, so I've got my two feet firmly on land. But yet, business is going well, [I] absolutely love doing that. It's very stressful, [a] different kind of stress to yachting. But I do miss yachting. Watching "Below Deck," me and Josiah are like, "Aw no, kind of making me jealous." But it's one of them games, where it's good to get into when you're younger, exhaust it, and get out. But yeah, very much do miss it. I miss the sunsets, I miss sleeping on a boat, because you get such a good sleep, I can't even explain to you. ... I think it's because of the rocking motion. So you don't have trouble sleeping, basically. I miss getting up in the morning, making my little coffee, sitting on the bow. Very much miss all of that.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>If I was younger, I definitely would've gone on with my husband, because he also has worked on yachts before. He's worked on Abramovich's boat before, as well, so if I was younger, I would've definitely gone in with him, as a couple. But [it's] not meant to be anymore, I don't think.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>I've gotta be honest, those beds — they look like they're triangles. They do not look like they're comfortable to sleep in at all. But I've never been on a super yacht, so I don't know.</strong></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Josiah:</strong> They are actually surprisingly comfortable.</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> They are comfortable, but they do look like a prison bed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2ljaoRze8muo6KZXZa7pXnJqKqimZhiwaa4y2aYpaRdpLtursSlprBllJqwrHnMnptmn5GhuabFjK2YpaNdmsWkuNSsoK%2BdXZ67tbHRr6Cer18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
