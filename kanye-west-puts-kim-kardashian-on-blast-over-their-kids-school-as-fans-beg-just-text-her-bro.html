A trailer of his song with eldest daughter North, Talking/One Again, and the post calling out his ex-wife.</p><p>The simple post contains a white background, with black text that reads: “KIM TAKE MY KIDS OUT OF SIERRA CANYON NOW IT’S A FAKE SCHOOL USED BY CELEBRITIES THAT ARE ‘USED BY THE SYSTEM'”.</p><p>In the caption of his post, which went out to his 20 million followers, the 46-year-old wrote: “At this point everybody knows what ‘the system’ is code word for.”</p><p>“I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children,” he continued. “When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate. My two oldest know they daddy is.”</p><p>West used to have his own school, Donda Academy, which his kids would attend for extracurricular activities.</p><p>However, the school closed ‘abruptly’ in October 2022 after the <a href=#>music</a> star’s anti-Semitism scandal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-baffled-by-the-post>Fans are baffled by the post</h2><p>Although the former couple aren’t on the best of terms, sharing four children together, it’s obvious they have each other’s numbers. Fans are therefore baffled as to why Kanye couldn’t text the SKIMs owner, instead of putting her on blast to 20 million people.</p><p>“Bro, just text her,” wrote one.</p><p>Another concerned fan questioned: “Why would you post the name of your chid’s school?”</p><p>“You got your kids walking around with a half-naked lady she needs to keep the kids from you,” wrote a third, referencing Censori’s scandalous outfits.</p><p>“Kanye, I don’t think is the best way to tell her,” wrote a fourth.</p><p>Kim hasn’t publically responded, and we’re not sure she will, but what we do know is Kris Jenner definitely won’t be best pleased with her ex-son-in-law.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eGcLfAp7CeZaeawLV5z66rrGWbnrput8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nOp2SbpJGowW671Z6pZqyYmrazecqim6xlo5i1sLvLZpisZZaWu7R5wZ6eZqKlqMFuwMSxq2aglad6o77OaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
