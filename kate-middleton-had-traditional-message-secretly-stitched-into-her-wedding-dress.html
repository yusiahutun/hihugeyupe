The <a href=#>royal wedding</a> is one of the most-watched special days in The Firm, with 29 million tuning in to see Harry and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> say ‘I do’ seven years later. Whereas, <a href=#>Princess Diana’</a>s wedding to the then Prince Charles, was broadcast to 750 million people across the globe, making it one of the most famous in history from the palace. 13 years on, we take a look at <a href=#>Kate Middleton’s wedding</a> dress and how it contained something hidden beneath the stitches.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-s-wedding-dress-and-the-secret-message-stitched-inside>Kate Middleton’s wedding dress and the secret message stitched inside</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-113264844-1024x627.jpg><p>The 42-year-old’s gorgeous gown resembled tradition and modernity for its time. Kate Middleton went to designer brand Alexander McQueen to create her special wedding dress for the joyous occasion, where they stitched hidden messages.</p><p>Designed by Sarah Burton, it was crafted with white and ivory satin gazar, with 58 buttons covered in gazar and organza, which were fastened by Rouleau loops.</p><p>But to give Kate Middleton ‘something blue’ for the wedding dress, they secretly stitched the traditional message by using a blue ribbon into the interior of the dress. For her ‘something borrowed’ the now mom-of-two wore the Queen’s Cartier tiara, and ‘something old’ was in the form of the lace used in her dress. Her parents, Michael and Carole, gifted her custom-made Robinson Pelham earrings for her to wear as her ‘something new’.</p><p>Kate also wore padding around her hips to create more of a dramatic shape around the hips, to follow Alexander McQueen’s style.</p><p>As reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Guides for Brides</a>, Kate chose four of her family and friends’ children to be bridesmaids at her wedding.</p><p>Said to be the Queen’s ‘favorite granddaughter’, Lady Louise Windsor – daughter of <a href=#>Prince Edward</a> and the Countess of Wessex – Grace van Custem, daughter of William’s friends, Eliza Hopes, granddaughter of <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a> and Margarita Armstrong-Jones.</p><p>Their dressed were designed by Nicki Macfarlane and used the same fabric as Kate Middleton’s wedding dress – and they had hidden messages too, such as their names and the date, being stitched into the lining.</p><p>They wore floral crowns to replicate the one worn by the Princess’ mom at her own wedding 30 years earlier.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-secrets-from-the-royal-wedding>Secrets from the royal wedding</h2><p>While UK weather is known to be unpredictable, it was warm on the day of the wedding. Fearing the heat would have an effect on William or his best man <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, their military tailors added sweat pads to the material to absorb heat and avoid any embarrassing sweat patches.</p><p>If you thought <a href=#>King Charles</a> didn’t have a hand in the big day, he actually picked some of the music for the pair.</p><p>He said in 2020: “I love trying to organize some interesting, I hope, pieces of <a href=#>music</a> for certain occasions, particularly for weddings if people want.</p><p>“I know my eldest son was quite understanding and was perfectly happy for me to suggest a few pieces for their wedding.”</p><p>Lastly, while royal weddings typically have a fruitcake for their wedding – which Kate and William did – they also had a second cake. The Prince’s favorite dessert is a chocolate biscuit cake (a royal family recipe), which was also the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>‘s favorite too.</p><p>But their official wedding Kate was eight tiers high and featured 900 handcrafted details made from sugar.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eGcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilZqCRmXq1vsCdoK2hn6OurXnMnqqsmZeaerSxwqucraSpYsC1tdOcn56cXZ67tbuMoZyrZaeasaW1zaBknaqVqMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
