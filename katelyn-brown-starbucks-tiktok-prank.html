Aldean’s surprise seems to be the concern of a good friend. “Isn’t that like your second home? Is this for real?” she continues, implying that the beloved coffee chain’s closing means particularly bad news for Katelyn.</p><p>Whether out of sympathy for unsettling Aldean or simply because she could no longer keep it together, Katelyn quickly explains, “I’m doing a TikTok and I needed your reaction,” much to the relief of Aldean. The two then share in the laughter as Katelyn says through giggles, “I love you so much.”</p><p>In addition to being a full-time mom and running her own swimsuit line, Katelyn seems to be a big prankster, and she may have learned it from hubby Kane. <a href=#>She was recently on the opposite end of his "trick question" prank</a>, among other pranks he's pulled on her during their quarantine downtime.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See the Cutest Pics of Kane Brown + Wife Katelyn Jae:</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJmkmrm6uoybqaivnmLAta3Rm6yco6Niwaq306iiZqiilrusew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
