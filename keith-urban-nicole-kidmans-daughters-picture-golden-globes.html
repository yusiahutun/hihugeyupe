Instead, first responders took the seats usually reserved for Hollywood A-listers like Kidman. She was nominated in the Actress for a Mini-Series or Picture for TV category for her role in The Undoing. Anya Taylor-Joy ultimately won the prize for her role in The Queen's Gambit.</p><p>Kidman and Urban have rarely brought either of their two daughters to public awards shows or appearances, making this cameo truly unique. Most often, fans on the hunt may have to settle for paparazzi pictures to see what the girls look like, although recently the actress&nbsp;shared video of them playing around her:</p><p>Urban's Instagram page is all business, aside from one or two photos where he's seen loving on his wife. The couple split their time between their Nashville area home and a home in Australia.</p><p>Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the 2021 Golden Globes, and at one point made a joke about Kidman's character in The Undoing. That led to cameras cutting to the family, showing the daughters in white dresses, Urban in a classic black suit with thin necktie, and 53-year-old Kidman in a Louis Vuitton gown. On Instagram, she shared more about her look:</p><p>In addition to Sunday and Faith, Kidman&nbsp;has two kids with ex-husband Tom Cruise, but is even more private about their lives.</p><p>"I'm very private about (Bella and Connor)," she told Who magazine in 2018. "I have to protect those relationships. I know 150 percent that I would give up my life for my children because it's what my purpose is. They are adults. They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and, as a mother, it’s my job to love them."</p><p>Musically, Urban recently learned he was nominated for&nbsp;two ACM Awards in the Musical Event of the Year category, for his collaboration with <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a> and friends on "Be a Light" and for his duet with Pink on "One Too Many."</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Urban Kidman Kids 2</span></p>Peter Kramer, Getty Images<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>See 11 Country Singers&nbsp;Who Had Kids Late&nbsp;in Life:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2ZqbVuwdGbmKdlnp6wsLjEZqKinJ2Wu7R5w5qsoKCkmr%2B0ec%2Bimq2topp6qLvLnZynZZehvKOx0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
