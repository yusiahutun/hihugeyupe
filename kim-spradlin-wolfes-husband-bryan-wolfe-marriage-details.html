Meet Bryan Wolfe</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-02-08</div><p><span>If <a href=#>HGTV</a> host </span><b>Kim Spradlin-Wolfe</b><span> looks familiar, it’s because she was able to outwit, outplay and outlast her competitors on season 24 of </span><a href=#><i><span>Survivor</span></i></a><span> in 2012. One year after her victory on the hit CBS show, she married her husband, </span><b>Bryan Wolfe</b><span>. He has remained her biggest supporter, especially as her cohost on the series </span><i><span>Why the Heck Did I Buy This House?</span></i><span> which premiered in March 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kim and Bryan wed in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in 2013. The couple met during a game of volleyball outside of a bar, per </span><a href=#><span>Heavy.com</span></a><span>. Kim’s </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span> castmates </span><b>Alicia Rosa</b><span> and </span><b>Kat Edorsson</b><span> were both guests at the wedding.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kim-Spradlin-Wolfes-Husband-Bryan-Wolfe-Marriage-Details.jpg><p><span>The pair decided to start a family shortly after they tied the knot, welcoming their first child together, son Michael Thomas, in 2014. Their daughter, August Jane, was born in 2015, followed by the birth of their youngest son, Walt, in 2016. When it came time for the former bridal shop owner to decide if she was going to be a part of the all-winners season of </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span> in 2019, she thoroughly discussed the topic with her husband.</span></p><p><span>“I just couldn’t picture a way where I was going to leave my three kids at this age,” she told </span><a href=#><i><span>Entertainment Weekly</span></i></a><span> in January 2020. “And then we talked about it for a while, and I was like, ‘It’s a no. And my husband was like, ‘Yeah, it’s a no.’ And then a week later, I was like, ‘I don’t know, I’m just kind of wondering if I should have the conversation.’ He was like, ‘You’re going to do it. I just know it already, the fact that you’re even putting a question mark on it.’”</span></p><p><span>Though she placed ninth in her second go at the game, fans were happy to see her again on television. She started her own <a href=#>interior design</a> company, Kim Wolfe Home, after winning </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span>, thanks to Bryan’s encouragement.</span></p><p><span>“He was like, ‘How about you do this professionally and stop making our family move every time you want to try a new tile?’” the television personality told </span><a href=#><span>HGTV</span></a><span> in March 2022. “And so that was really kind of the birth of this as a career for me.”</span></p><p><span>Kim has been on television before, but </span><i><span>Why the Heck Did I Buy This House? </span></i><span>is her husband’s first time in front of the cameras. However, Bryan is doing a great job and has plenty of home design expertise to contribute to the program.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46koKZlo6W%2ForDLoqVmr5%2Bhs6a%2FjKGsrJqRo7FurtGymKdlp6S5p7GMppirqpmWtKZ5w56rmqGcqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
