Some even tagged Cyr in the video. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Kio Cyr Responds to Austin Mahone Hitting on His Girlfriend</h2><p>And then, Cyr responded to Mahone hitting on&nbsp;his girlfriend on August 22, 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He stitched Mahone’s video, after which the clip switched to him and Diaz in a room. Diaz was lying on the bed using her phone while Cyr was propped up on a chair.</p><p>He looked over at Diaz and then at the camera and said, “I chose peace to avoid violence,” with a little laugh and ended the video zooming in on his annoyed and jealous face.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Kio&nbsp;Cyr responds to Austin Mahone hitting on&nbsp;his girlfriend. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In the caption, he simply tagged the singer.

Cyr did not reply to him probably because his fans had done it for him on his behalf.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They asked Mahone to back off and said there was no way Diaz would choose the singer over her current boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Austin Mahone Says It’s All Good</h2><p>Later, Mahone <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">commented</a> it was all good, and that he had no intention of coming between them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“It’s all good. They have way more history,” commented the singer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Previously in July 2022, there were rumors that Diaz and Cyr had <a href=# rel=follow>broken up</a> after the former posted a TikTok with another man.&nbsp;At the time, Diaz was vacationing in Ibiza, Spain, and Cyr had not gone with her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the video, some man with tattoos all over his hand fed her a piece of bread. And since Cyr did not have tattoos like that, fans suspected there was trouble in paradise. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They claimed that Diaz and Cy had broken up, but before it could escalate, the former replied to a comment, writing, “I can have friends.
