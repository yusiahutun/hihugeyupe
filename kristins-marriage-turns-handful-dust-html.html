And the next day at 10am, he left the flat dressed in the same clothes he was wearing the night before.</p><p>Their tender moments were shared last Sunday and spell the end of Kristin's 18-year marriage to French IVF specialist Professor Francois Olivennes.</p><p>Recently the 44-year-old actress has been in London rehearsing with Bob Hoskins and Margaret Tyzack for As You Desire Me, which opens at the Playhouse Theatre on Thursday. Her husband has stayed with their three children at home in Paris. They also have a farmhouse in Burgundy, but it appears that what Kristin once described as her 'fairytale life' is now in tatters.</p><p>She first met Tobias, 31, two years ago, but rumours of a relationship only surfaced this month. He is touring the country with Alan Bennett's acclaimed The History Boys. He has appeared in Midsomer Murders and Casualty and plays Marcus Junius Brutus in the BBC's sexandviolence drama, Rome.</p><p>A colleague of Professor Olivennes at the Procreation Hospital in Paris said he was 'shattered' by the 'crisis' in his marriage, adding: 'Francois is in a very bad way. Rumours that Kristin has been gallivanting around London with another man have broken his heart.</p><p>'He has even followed her to London to try to find out what's going on. He wants her back in Paris.' Until recently she had been travelling to Paris on Fridays to spend the weekend with their children Hannah, 16, Joseph, 14, and four-year-old George.</p><p>Kristin has earned plaudits for her roles in The Horse Whisperer, Gosford Park, Four Weddings And A Funeral and The English Patient, for which she was nominated for an Oscar. She has played a string of flawed, frustrated women who often find in infidelity a comfort that their own marriage lacks.</p><p>Intriguingly, her favourite part was of Lady Brenda, the faithless wife of the hero in A Handful Of Dust. The film was based on Evelyn Waugh's novel of the same title, a thinly-veiled account of the breakdown of his own marriage.</p><p>Referring to her career, she once said: 'I'm very grateful for adultery.'</p><p>Despite often being referred to as sexy and beautiful, she once said: 'Men don't fall in love with me - only young ones. I've had to tell some young actors to calm down.'</p><p>Last night Professor Olivennes refused to discuss his marriage difficulties.</p><p>Tobias Menzies' agent confirmed that her client was dating Kristin. She said: 'They are going out together. I don't think anybody's denying that. But he won't want to make any further comment.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmpvbmJqhnCX0aKqraGeqHqurdGroJqflWLBtr7NrGShmZ6Zs7a4jJ2srKxencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
