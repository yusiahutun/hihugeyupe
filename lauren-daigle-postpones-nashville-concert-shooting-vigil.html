"All I can do is stare out of this airplane window at our devastated city below. My mind is consumed with the pain and heartache impacting this entire city," she wrote. "The victims. The children. The teachers. The families. The school staff. The responding officers. There are no words."</p><p>"Now is not the time for a political debate (on my page) Lives have been lost," she added. "Hearts are forever broken. Families are devastated. Let's lift up these angels in prayer. Ask God to give these families the strength to make it through the unimaginable days ahead. üôèüèºüíî"</p><p>Jessie James Decker, who also lives in Nashville, was in tears as she went to Instagram as well.</p><p>"A lot of you are messaging, and it's not my kids' school, but it's only two miles up the road. It's in our town, it's in our community, and it's just awful," she said. "I'm just heartbroken for these families. Please pray so hard for these families and this community. This just should not be happening. I went and picked the kids up immediately, and they're home safe. What is happening in the world?"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Former Olympian Shawn Johnson also lives in the area -- and revealed her kids' school went under lockdown after hearing about the shooting nearby. Noting her two children were okay, she added, "I feel lucky and blessed but still so incredibly sad. No parent or family should ever have to deal with this."</p><p>"I've seen childrens ambulances, countless police cars, buses of children being transported to safety, parents flying down the street laying on their horns, people sprinting in and out of churches and schools looking for their kids," she added. "Today has changed me."</p><a id=gallery-link-c662fcc0-5c76-4056-95d6-239cdf5f02f8 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:c662fcc0-5c76-4056-95d6-239cdf5f02f8 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:159bfb8c-2d6f-49a4-857a-fc165e01f8d0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7c/4by3/2023/03/28/7cdf7cf12e174b5aad66dba331e11207_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma3Bfoa62vsSnZJ2ZmZy5pnnPqKqtqJ%2BjsrR5zZqqoa6ZobmmecKopZydoql6tLTOqKuippdiw6qzyKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
