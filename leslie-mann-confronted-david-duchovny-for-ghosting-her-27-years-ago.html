I met him 25 years ago when we were working in Vancouver," Mann told hosts <a href=#>Kelly Ripa</a> and <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a>. "I was working on my first job, a TV show called 'Birdland'. He was doing the 'X-Files' I thought, 'He's really into me. Maybe we'll date or something.'"</p><p>She continued, "He invited me to his set and I invited him to a Halloween party I was having in my hotel room. And then after the party, we decided to go to a bar to have a drink. We get into the cab — David, my best friend, and me — and he stops the cab, gets out of the cab, runs away, and doesn't speak to me again for 27 years."</p><p>27 years later, Leslie revealed that she was able to confront Duchovny while working on their newest project "The Bubble."</p><p>"For 27 years, my best friend and I would talk about everything. What went wrong? What happened?" she recalled. "So anyway, then, we had this reunion on 'The Bubble' and I'm like, 'S---, it's going to be weird.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8fa9ecb0-21e6-4faa-b939-6455245618e4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8b3e31f7-c8a3-42e4-b3f6-b2dcd91d9f7e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ca/5by4/2021/08/26/ca2f4b85cd6e42f78e13cec1815fbc67_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">David Duchovny Claims Scientology Tried to Recruit Him</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Mann described the confrontation, "I work up the courage to go ask him what happened, 'Why'd you get out of the cab?' And he was like, 'Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I kind of remember that. I don't know. I probably just left my weed in my room or something.' It's terrible! ... It wasn't personal. He needed the weed!"</p><p>Perhaps it was all for the best as Leslie is now married to <a href=#>Judd Apatow</a> and the duo share two children <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/maudeapatow>Maude</a>, 24 and Iris, 19.</p><p>Apatow is the director of "The Bubble" and oversaw Leslie's work with Duchovny, including their numerous lovemaking scenes, some of which were later cut.</p><p>Regarding those steamy scenes with the "Californication" heartthrob, Leslie said, "You know how people say doing the love scene stuff is awful and technical and it’s no fun? I don’t know if that's --."</p><p>"Are they misrepresenting it?" Ryan interjected, attempting to help her clarify. "Is that what you're saying?"</p><p>"Maybe?" Leslie said. "Perhaps?"</p><p>"It's only fun when you're doing it," she went on to joke, "and when you're thinking about it afterwards and when you're watching it…"</p><p>Mann then broke out laughing, admitting: "This is terrible."</p><p>Meanwhile, she told Kelly and Ryan how "crazy" it is she and Apatow are about to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary.</p><p>"It's such a big one," she said. "I feel so lucky that I get to spend my life with him. He really is a good person. And at the same time, I feel like I do not know him at all."</p><a id=gallery-link-9f744c6f-98a3-4c91-bdee-e832e464bfa7 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9f744c6f-98a3-4c91-bdee-e832e464bfa7 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:8b3e31f7-c8a3-42e4-b3f6-b2dcd91d9f7e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a0/4by3/2022/03/29/a01c2f98ea464868b34573de51919b54_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xmbGlfobK0uMieZKaZnqN6pLvNn6mopqSasW6wwK%2BgnWWUqrCpu9WnsGaen6d6qLTOrKuippditaa%2BjGtuZrGVlr%2B0ecCgpmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
