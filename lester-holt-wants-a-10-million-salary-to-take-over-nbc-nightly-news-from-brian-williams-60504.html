Though a final decision about bringing the father-of-two back from his suspension has not yet been made, NBC execs allegedly hope to keep the veteran journalist at the network in some capacity. However, sources expect he will leave if Lester is asked to take over as the new anchor of Nightly News.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46lnKyslad6qbvLrWSwmZ6pwG6tjGpnZqWZobmqu81mqpqkkafGbsDOZquao5VivLex0Walm5tdo7aotNOlsGamlazAbrLRqKRmmqKerq951qKjpaGRosBugo9uZ21n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
