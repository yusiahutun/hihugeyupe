She says that she and Bones&nbsp;brought&nbsp;out the best out in each other, and it has been hard, but "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger and I will have lots to write about."</p><p><strong>Lindsay Ell&nbsp;Proves She's a&nbsp;One-Woman RockStar&nbsp;With This "Criminal" Performance</strong></p><p>The former couple&nbsp;have been vocal about the fact that their breakup stemmed from the controversy Ell experienced in the summer of 2017, when a radio station in Sacramento <a href=#>canceled her appearance</a> due to Bones' affiliation with iHeartRadio, a competitor for the California station. Bones broke the news during his morning radio show.</p><p>"I've been dating Lindsay for over a year. We've known each other a few years. We started dating and I was like, 'We probably should think about this before we date because it could hurt your career,'" he explains. "'Other radio stations, Spotify, they're going to hold it against you that you're dating me. I don't even know these people but they're going to hold it against you.' And they did."</p><p>Ell turned to <a href=#>Instagram</a> in the days&nbsp;that followed&nbsp;to&nbsp;acknowledge the split,&nbsp;writing to her followers,&nbsp;"Life is hard sometimes ... and doesn’t always go the way you want. Love should always win, no matter what. But life isn’t always in our control. This isn’t what I wanted. But thank you for all your love and support over the past few days ... you guys make me strong."</p><p><strong>More Painful Country Breakups We Still Haven't Gotten Over</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpaGemcCixYyeo6VlkqSvo8WMm6annaNir7OxwKSsqWWjpLuov44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
