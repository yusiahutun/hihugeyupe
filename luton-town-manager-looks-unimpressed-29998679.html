That was after fans couldn't help but notice his stoic look on the back of the biggest win of his managerial career to date.</p><p><b><i>Which team do you think will win the Championship play-offs?

Edwards' progress at Kenilworth Road is all the more impressive given he only took over from Nathan Jones in November, guiding the club from 13th to a third-place finish.</p><p>"What a job Rob Edwards has done," tweeted BBC Sport's Sanny Rudravajhala. "And what a journey in 12 months!" The manager said in his post-match comments that he didn't want to 'sing from the rooftops as nothing's done yet', though he did celebrate a 'brilliant season' for Luton.</p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Luton star helped club win National League and is now on verge of promotion to Prem</a></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29998743.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_GettyImages-1255315223.jpg><p>Fans stormed the field after Luton sealed their 3-2 aggregate win over the Black Cats, mobbing Edwards and his players in a show of appreciation. However, Edwards was perhaps wary of the fact the Hatters are only one win better off than last season's semi-final collapse against <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Huddersfield</a>.</p><p>The former <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Wolves</a> and <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Blackpool</a> defender played only a handful of games in the Premier League and spent the vast majority of his career in England's second tier. Edwards was part of the Seasiders squad that clinched Premier League promotion under Ian Holloway via the play-offs in 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29999028.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Luton-Town-v-Sunderland-Sky-Bet-Championship-Play-Off-Semi-Final-Second-Leg.jpg><p>Now on the other side of the touchline, he faces a chance to lead his own group of underdogs to the peak of English football. Boro and Coventry clash at the Riverside on Wednesday evening to determine who will line up against the Hatters in just under a fortnight.</p><p>A win at Wembley would be more than enough reason for Edwards to allow himself at least a smirk after realising a Premier League comeback. The same can't be said for <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Watford</a>, however, who may be <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>kicking themselves after sacking the Welsh whiz</a> earlier this season.</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Fans slam Watford's 'worst decision ever' as Rob Edwards puts Luton Town on brink of Prem</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=photo-story>Smallest Premier League grounds ever with Luton on brink of promotion to top-flight</a></b></p></li><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>'My dog chewed through my play-off tickets - the blood just drained from me'</b></a></p></li><li><p><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Sheff Utd fan climbs up traffic light to celebrate promotion - and player lobs him a beer</a></b></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney admit they 'disagree' about the running of Wrexham</b></a></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLjUraanZaSkxK95zJqlmp%2BVp3qtu86kqmatnp66sb7ErKqenF1nhnqFl29ucg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
