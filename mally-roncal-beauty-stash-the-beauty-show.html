The tour starts upstairs in her dressing area, where she has an entire vanity covered with her makeup specifically for television appearances and photoshoots. "I really wear a lot of makeup. It's all good, that's what we do," she says. After walking us through her entire skincare routine. Roncal takes us down to the kitchen where her real day-to-day, go-to products live.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Believe it or not, I actually do a lot of product development work in here," she says in the kitchen. "I have a Vitamix that we use more for foundation and highlighter than for smoothies. Truthfully, most days I don't wear a full face of makeup. I do what I can do to get out of the house without scaring my neighbors." One cabinet drawer holds products like her Face Defender, Neutralizing Primer, and Dark Circle Corrector, while the other holds hair brushes and accessories for her three little girls.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But a bulk of Roncal's products are kept in her home office, where she develops new products for Mally Beauty. She gave BAZAAR an exclusive sneak peek at the new Ru Palette, a collaboration with RuPaul launching in the spring of next year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shop Roncal's entire beauty stash above—and watch the entire video to learn about her time as Beyonce's go-to makeup artist.

While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAa2xqa2VmfXV7zJqjpbFdp7yvr8ClZJudkarBunnSrZisoF2ptaZ5wZ6YrqypYsCpu9Zo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
