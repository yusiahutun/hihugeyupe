We sat with a group of people from Coty, we were just talking and they had some rough ideas, visuals to show me. We all gravitated towards this idea of a Daisy on a bottle. I don't know which came first: the name of the bottle or whatever. I had a dog named Daisy, and she got her name from Daisy Buchanan of The Great Gatsby. Daisy is one of my favorite characters in literature. Plus, I love the irony of a floral coming from a flower that had no scent. So all those things appealed to me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It wasn't a very researched moment or calculated moment. The perfumer, you know, was inspired by the story I told, and all of a sudden, there was a juice and a bottle and a box. And then, it was very easy to kind of create the imagery or the communication, because I felt like Daisy was this spirit that existed in everybody. That naive spirit—it's been such a symbol in so many different places. We can just tell the story with, like, people—young women, in this case—on the beach, or in the grass, with that kind of freshness and the kind of youthful freedom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was very easy and instinctive to create the world of Daisy. We all always hope for a success, but I don't think anybody thought that was going to be such a success, you know?</p><img alt="marc jacobs perfect eau de toilette" title="marc jacobs perfect eau de toilette" width=832 height=852 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-01-23-at-2-20-29-pm-1674501640.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Marc Jacobs</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On capturing the cultural zeitgeist through scent …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think it's kind of instinctive. It starts out as like a project, right? Coty comes to me and is like, "Okay, we want to do a new fragrance." I think like, "Oh, my God, what's it going to be?" Then through a process, which is, like, responding to visuals, listening to conversations, going away, digesting it, coming back, saying like, "I think it should be called Perfect." I mean, it's the same way we do a collection. It's just this process of thinking and talking, interacting, and then actually having, like, that physical creative moment where you start putting things together and making something that illustrates all those different thoughts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The storytelling and the communication, which, for me, it's such a big part of it. Fragrance is a very personal thing. In terms of the actual fragrance—I mean, I like it, I think it's a beautiful fragrance, but it's not something I could be romantic or talk to you about in a way that I could if we were talking about the casting for the ads, or the bottle, or the box.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On how his perspective on beauty has changed in the last three years …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I continue to be excited by the changes I see in the beauty industry and the fragrance industry. I think something like Perfect in terms of what we've done and how we've communicated these ideas, or cast, or, you know, the whole spirit, like, it just couldn't have happened 10 years ago. There was no space; people wouldn't allow for it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So what excites me now is seeing the change in the beauty industry, seeing this little crack in the window, or this little opening in the door, that just start spreading a little bit wider and allowing for a little bit more. I think that's the most exciting thing, you know, in my lifetime: seeing evidence of change.</p><img alt="the marc jacobs perfect party" title="The Marc Jacobs Perfect Party" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/view-of-marc-jacobs-perfect-fragrance-on-display-during-the-news-photo-1674501467.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dimitrios Kambouris</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On designing Perfect's new bottle …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I feel like I'm demystifying the situation every time I explain these things. It was brought to my attention that Coty who wanted to do an eau de toilette. So I have these boxes and boxes filled with all of these charms from the first bottle, but I had asked for them in different colors, different shades, different finishes, levels of transparency, like milkiness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So over a vacation—I don't know whether it was, like, a summer vacation, or it was a Christmas vacation two years ago, whenever it was, I don't know, I lose all track of time—but I got down these boxes and I said, "Okay, let me try to put these charms together in a way that says eau de toilette." For me, that means it has a kind of freshness to it, a transparency and brightness. These are the stories I told myself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I started putting these different textures and colors together, and came up with what I thought told that story, which was, like, this milky, glassy sort of transparency, blues and greens, silvers, and something that felt like it had a cleaner, brighter spirit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Remember, what came before was Perfect Intense—which was, like, black, gold, silver, and bright yellow. I took home two bottles of the new the EDT, and I put them on my shelf next to the other ones and I was like, "Wow, you know, it really does look very, very different than the one before, and the one before that." And it's funny, because when I'm in it, you know, when I'm doing this thing, I'm very focused.</p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$136 at Nordstrom for Marc Jacobs Perfect Eau de Parfum"

css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On fashion designers becoming more involved in beauty …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I always think like, "Oh, my God, everybody is just as involved in everything." Like, I don't think I'm more involved or less, you know? I think maybe this is my own insecurity. I think like, "Oh, I bet [the other designers] are there with the nose." I've got visions of, like, this fictitious designer who's literally making fragrance. My shrink tells me this all the time. He's like, "You have this image, this fictitious idea of this imaginary person who does everything perfectly without any stress?" That's what I imagine. I fall short when I compare myself to that imaginary person.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are days where I feel like being involved and days where it's just like, "Leave me alone. I don't want to do this." But Coty has been a really great partner. Flankers are always a tricky thing. Because I'm like, "How can you possibly make so many different things?" It's almost like knitting—when it comes to putting the colors and the shapes together—even if it's driving me a little bit crazy while I'm doing it, it is therapeutic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I do like it. I like the creative part of it. And I do love working, you know, with Katie [Grand] and Juergen [Teller] on the ads, and Peter [Miles] on the art direction. I do love telling the story. I like the visuals, and I like the things you see.</p><img alt="marc jacobs perfect, perfect intense, and perfect eau de toilette" title="marc jacobs perfect, perfect intense, and perfect eau de toilette" width=838 height=840 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-01-23-at-2-19-27-pm-1674501582.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Marc Jacobs</span></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On how his public face-lift changed how he thinks about beauty …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've learned that if I take care of myself—whatever that means, there was a period where it meant going to the gym six times a week and doing two hours of partner yoga four times a week—but whatever I need to do, so that I feel good, and I can be of service to others, participate in my day, and I can feel good about getting dressed, I have to do.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wanted to do this plastic surgery, and I kind of went on and off about it. And then, I was just like, 'No, I'm gonna do it.' And then afterwards, I really loved the results. I felt like I needed to do this—not needed, actually—this is what I wanted to do. And it's no different than wearing perfume, high heels to work, or, you know, other things I want to do or wear that help me feel good about myself.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On the public's reaction to his face-lift …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I loved it. I didn't realize it would be such a big deal. I've become very, very friendly with my doctor who did the surgery. People have so much shame around Botox, surgery, dyeing their hair, you name it. I've learned that when I'm very open about those things, the shame disappears. There's nothing to hide. So it serves me well. But it's still funny how there are people who, I think, feel like they're embarrassed that they're doing this or that. They don't want people to know.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On what Gen Z gets right and wrong about the '90s and Y2K aesthetic …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don't know that they're getting anything wrong. I never thought I'd be the person who says like, "Back in the day, this is the way it was." But, you know, for all those Gen Z people out there—I didn't always have a smartphone, or know how to use a computer. Like, it wasn't part of my education. So things like social media and other techy things that they're so adept at, I'm not.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When we were doing what we were doing in the year 2004, or just before, I think there was this false sense that things would always be that way, that my generation was the generation that would define the rest of time. You know what I mean? I never sat down and actually thought that. But in the past, like, there was the '20s, and the '60s, but for me, I just felt like, well, we're not going to experience that shift that happened historically. So, of course, thinking about that now makes no sense at all; of course, we're going to experience it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But when I see young people who say that they're inspired by those times, and when I look at what the product of that inspiration is, I don't see the parallel, you know? But, of course, it's their interpretation of what they've looked at, so I can't look at things through the lens or the eyes of anybody but my generation. I'm just not that generation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It makes perfect sense that a person under the age of 30 would look back, just like I was looking back to a period way before me, and I'm inspired by that period. And I'm sure anyone from that period would have looked at what my take on that inspiration was and say that had nothing to do with it, you know? So I think this is just all a question of everything is exactly the way it always was. History repeats itself in certain ways. The landscape, you know, of life and physical landscape, and people's way of being just continues to change. Change is constant.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On the best-smelling person he's ever met …</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My husband. That sounds like a very Donna Karan thing. When she was developing her fragrance, they said, "What do you want it to smell like?" And she said, "The back of Stephan's neck," who was, I guess, her husband? Or, you know what? There's another answer: Lady [my dog]. I would say Neville [another of my dogs], but Lady smells much better than Neville. Puppies smell really good.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content.
