“Look what I’m wrapping my dad’s xmas gifts in,” the 20-year-old wrote over her Instagram Story photo showing various presents being covered up using Marvel wrapping paper — which shows images of everyone from Captain America to The Hulk to Ant-Man.
This fun prank comes after the iconic director said that all those successful Marvel films aren’t exactly “cinema."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Since his comments bothered many people who have worked tirelessly on various Marvel films, Martin did his best to clarify his comments when he sat-down with The New York Times.</p><p>“Many of the elements that define cinema as I know it are there in Marvel pictures,” the&nbsp;Taxi Driver director told the outlet.&nbsp;“What’s not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/martin-Scorsese.jpg><p>“They are sequels in name but they are remakes in spirit, and everything in them is officially sanctioned because it can’t really be any other way,” he added. “That’s the nature of modern film franchises: market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they’re ready for consumption.”</p><p>We’re hoping Martin found his daughter’s joke funny, as it was quite the trolling. Aside from Francesca — who the filmmaker shares with wife Helen Morris — Martin also has two more kids. He has daughters Cathy, 54, and Domenica, 43, from two previous marriages.</p><p>Martin’s&nbsp;The Irishman is currently streaming on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>. It also features no superheroes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKusmaN6tK%2FOq6qeq5WoeqWt1KCfrZ2iYsGzu8ulqmagmaJ6uLXToWSmmaKrsq15xqKdrWWnp66xew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
