She is an actress best known for her role in the popular family drama “This Is Us.”&nbsp;</p><p>Metz’s talents have earned her much recognition and awards, including two Golden Globes nominations, one Emmy nomination, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Given how famous she has become since “This Is Us” was first released, it is no wonder that Metz’s fans are curious about her personal life, especially the romantic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p>That includes her marriage and divorce from the less famous British screenwriter Martyn Eaden. Eaden walked out on their union while calling Metz, who may still have been willing to save their marriage, many names and adjectives.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Martyn_Eaden_and_Chrissy_Metz_Meet></span>How Did Martyn Eaden and Chrissy Metz Meet?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Martyn Eaden met Chrissy Metz</a> on a dating app. At the time, he had still been abroad, so they had no choice but to wing it long-distance for some time before they decided to take things further.&nbsp;</p><p>Eaden, who lived in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, would travel to the States to meet Metz. That went on for about a year before he popped the big question to the actress.&nbsp;</p><p>When they decided to marry, they traveled to Santa Barbara, California, to tie the knot in 2008. The ceremony was a small one. Neither of the pair’s parents attended the event because they reportedly lacked the funds to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Metz was happy, but she could not help but notice that her relationship with Eaden was turbulent right from the get-go. In her 2018 memoir, “This Is Me: Loving the Person You Are Today,” Metz detailed the fall of their union. They were uncomfortable confiding in one another and were too focused on growing their careers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_Troubles_Martyn_Eaden_and_Chrissy_Metz_Faced_in_Their_Marriage></span>Some Troubles Martyn Eaden and Chrissy Metz Faced in Their Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first issue Chrissy Metz first noticed was Martyn Eaden’s bond with her parents or the lack of it. In her memoir, she pointed out how Eaden had trouble getting along with her “loud and outgoing” family, but that was just the beginning.</p><p>Families joined by a wedding do not always get along. This is a known fact; it was not exactly a tie-breaker in Eaden and Metz’s case.&nbsp;</p><p>The natural downward spiral began when Eaden and Metz approached weight loss differently. Metz opted to join Overeating Anonymous while Eaden started to hike with a female co-worker.&nbsp;</p><p>In her memoir, Metz claimed she felt guilty about her anger towards her husband. She said he was trying to regain control of her body and break her habit of comfort eating, but it affected the time she could spend with Eaden.&nbsp;</p><p>Metz <a href=#>wrote</a>: “I was trying so hard to get ahold of my relationship with my body and break my habit of eating my emotions and of equating food with sharing love. I didn’t know how to spend time with Marty without using food.”</p><p>It spelled the beginning of the end for what they had.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chrissy_Metzs_Divorce_From_Eaden_Was_Nasty></span>Chrissy Metz’s Divorce From Eaden Was Nasty<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chrissy Metz and Martyn Eaden decided to end their marriage after they visited her parents finally. Metz asked him at that point if he still wished to be tethered to her, and in his response, he called her “selfish” and “narcissistic” because she made things about herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Eaden reportedly filed for divorce in November 2014. However, Metz refused to respond to the filing. Seemingly unwilling to break things off with the handsome screenwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>He requested that the judge grant his uncontested divorce, and by December 2015, the judge agreed and did so. After the divorce, Metz and Eaden were able to get past their differences and remain friends.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair regularly update each other about what is happening in their lives via text messages. Despite the split, Metz has said that she still loves Eaden and never fails to check up on him.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “We’re just not the right fit. But I love him, and I’m always checking in on him. I am still working on being a better ex-wife than I was a wife.” Since their split, Metz has continued to grow by leaps and bounds in her career. She has also been involved with other men, including cameraman Josh Stancil.&nbsp;</p><p>While she is single now, Metz may not return to the dating app that helped her find Eaden because of how things ended. She is but one of the many stars who have sought companionship via dating apps.&nbsp;Other actors that have tried dating apps include <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a>, Adam Rippon, Ariana Grande, and Dua Lipa.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqK%2B07KlZp2RmbKvecKao6WdlGKwqb7IrKqyZZ2awbt5zJqlsmWelrqmv4ywn56mXam1psWMrKeloaRitq%2B%2FyJ2cZqyYmrazecOiraiqk5p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
