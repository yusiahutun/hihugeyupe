But actor Danny Pino talks of his character’s mental state to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p id=par-8_42>“Miguel is absolutely at rock bottom, and I think you see that in the final scene — that desperation, that confusion, that need for somebody to help him,” Pinot tells the publication. “I don’t think that he’s ever actually felt that before.”</p><p id=par-9_48>Pino also mentioned Miguel’s time working at the convent, which is where viewers saw him in episode 7. The once-great leader of the MC is now completely changing, both physically and mentally. He also connected with a young boy, Tomas, who reminds him of his own fatherly instincts.</p><p id=par-10_75>“The link that he had with Tomas — the young boy in the convent — speaks to his sense of fatherhood, of being paternal, of missing his son,” Pino adds. “Now finally being out of the convent, I think the questions are appropriate: Is Soledad going to be a lifeline, or is she going to make his life more miserable? Or is she going to end his life because of her tie with El Banquero?”&nbsp;</p><h2>Danny Pino hinted at a ‘metamorphosis’ for Miguel by the end of the season</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_45>It’s clear from Miguel’s appearance in Mayans MC Season 4 Episode 8 that he’s seriously changed from the first season.
