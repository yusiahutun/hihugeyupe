The lyrics convey a sense of empowerment and self-assuredness, encouraging listeners to let go of inhibitions and fully embrace the joy and freedom that comes with personal achievement. While the song appears to be a party anthem on the surface, the lyrics hold more depth and provide insightful commentary on various aspects of life.One standout lyric that contributes to the song's overarching theme is, "Niggas is dogs, who walks 'em? Talkin' shit cheap, who bought some? Yeah. Look at you ballin', flossin', yeah. Look at you ballin', flossin', yeah." This lyric reflects the idea that success and confidence are not dependent on validation from others. It highlights the importance of self-belief and not allowing external opinions to dictate one's sense of self-worth. The act of "ballin' and flossin'" symbolizes the boldness to shine and stand out in a world where conformity often prevails.Another notable lyric that adds depth to the song is, "Tell me all the money that you make off that. That you make off that. Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat. Peanut butter jelly with a, peanut butter jelly. Y'all ain't ready for this jelly, it'll break y'all back. It'll break y'all back." This playful and whimsical lyric juxtaposes the idea of financial success with a childhood snack. It subtly reminds listeners that material wealth alone does not define true achievement or happiness. The use of the "peanut butter jelly" metaphor invites us to embrace the childlike joy of life and seek fulfillment beyond monetary measures.Moving forward, the lyric, "I got big dreams (Come on), super big eyes (Come on, come on). Retro ride, Marty McFly. Big Day, super big vibes. Let's get right, loosen this tie. Move inside, move to the side. Group, then slide, group and then slide (Come on, yeah). Then slide (Aw, yeah)" emphasizes the idea of dreaming big and pursuing one's passions with unwavering determination. The reference to Marty McFly from the iconic movie 'Back to the Future' reinforces the concept of embracing one's individuality and being unafraid to stand out. The repetition of "slide" signifies the importance of adaptability and moving through life's challenges with fluidity.Throughout the song, Chance the Rapper invites us to celebrate our uniqueness and not be afraid to fully embrace and express ourselves. In the lyric, "A nigga really wanna see y'all bounce, 79th, bounce. Out south, bounce, north side, bounce (Igh). Over east, bounce, 290, bounce. Downtown, bounce, down-down, downtown," he encourages listeners to let loose, dance, and celebrate their individuality.
