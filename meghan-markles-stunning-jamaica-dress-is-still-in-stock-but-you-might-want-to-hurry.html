She was joined by her husband <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, and they looked all smiles as they stepped out and interacted with other guests such as the country’s prime minister Andrew Holness. The <a href=#>movie</a>, Bob Marley: One Love, is set to come out on Valentine’s Day (February 14). It follows Marley’s life and career, up until the <a href=#>celebrity’s</a> died in 1981. The film stars Kingsley Ben-Adir, whose most recently released project was <a href=#>Barbie</a> in which he portrayed Basketball Ken.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1957000255-1-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-jamaica-dress-is-one-of-her-favorite-designers>Meghan Markle’s Jamaica dress is one of her favorite designers</h2><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> had fans talking about her choice of dress in Jamaica on Tuesday. The designer piece comes from <a href=# rel=nofollow>Carolina Herrera</a> and costs a whopping $2,390.00. The Silk Taffeta Ball Skirt comes in various colors, black, royal blue, sky blue, as well as a lighter and deeper shade of red. The sizes range from 0 up to 14.</p><p>However, you may want to act fast because it’s sold out in almost all sizes.</p><p>Made from silk, the description for the skirt reads: “Make an entrance in this elegant ball skirt, crafted from lustrous silk taffeta with hand-gathered pleats and side pockets. Pair it back with a leather square buckle belt.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Golden Globes: Meghan Markle ‘snubbed’ by Suits co-star as she’s missing from reunion</a></p><p>As well as the dress, the 42-year-old accessorized for the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> premiere with a Jimmy Choo clutch purse. She wore her hair up in a low bun and wore a barely-there makeup look. Her husband didn’t go to the premiere lacking either, as he donned a black suit and white shirt, complimenting the former <a href=#>TV</a> actress’ two-piece.</p><p>This was the couple’s second trip to the island, as they attended Harry’s friend’s wedding in 2017, a year before they got married.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-hollywood-comeback>Meghan’s Hollywood comeback</h2><p>Meghan <a href=#>attending the film red carpet</a> in the dress earlier this week may not have been a coincidence, as there has been a lot of buzz and speculation the <a href=#>royal</a> might return to her career in some capacity. It isn’t certain when or how, with many <a href=#>arguing its more likely to be behind the camera</a> rather than in front of it.</p><p>Celebrity Tidbit was exclusively told by psychic Adam Norton he believes Prince William’s sister-in-law will return to her former career this year, though he sees her producing behind the scenes rather than center stage.</p><p>“I actually feel Meghan will return to work, so her career is about to take off in a different direction,” Adam said.</p><p>“I see some movie and acting work ahead for her, so definitely expect to see her on the big screen. Both behind and in front of the camera, so there’s some acting work she’ll be doing, but also a little bit of directing and behind-the-scenes action.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle defended after Duchess’ ‘attempts to break into Hollywood’ fails</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eDcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y56qZqukqruvtc2gZKOZnZa2pK2Mnameq6NitrR50q2gpaRdnrtuv9OomqRlkqrBbsXOrmSmoZedwW7DwKerZqyfYrW2vtGyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
