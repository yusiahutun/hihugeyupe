My toiletry bag isn’t just sitting in my room completely empty, so what replaced those items, you might ask? Two words: <a href=# id=auto-tag_merit-beauty data-tag=merit-beauty>Merit Beauty</a>. The brand calls itself a minimalist makeup brand; however, it just made its foray into skincare. Merit Beauty has already won me (and </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>Cameron Diaz</span></a><span>) over with its foundation, lip products and dewy balms, so I have no doubt its new <a href=# id=auto-tag_serum data-tag=serum>serum</a> is up to par.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p><span>There are so many </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>serums</span></a><span> on the market that it can be hard to pinpoint one to invest in. If you’re currently overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options, try out the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Great Skin Instant Glow Serum</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The formula contains four types of </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>hyaluronic acid</span></a><span>—a true skincare MVP—to deliver loads of deep hydration that lasts all day long. Plus, </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>niacinamide</span></a><span> helps even skin texture, caffeine-charged </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>cacao seed extract</span></a><span> plumps and Japanese goldthread root calms skin. Overall, the product promises to maintain a healthy skin barrier and prep your complexion for the rest of your makeup routine. The Great Skin Instant Glow Serum has already sold out once, but is finally back in stock. That’s why you’ll want to scoop up a bottle ASAP.</span></p><p><span>However, you certainly don’t have to wear makeup on top of the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>serum</span></a><span>. In fact, one reviewer doesn’t.</span></p><p><span>“This product is divine! My skin was quenched and glowing, and I actually went the whole day bare-skinned, which I never do,” raved one five-star shopper. “I also usually break out after using any new product, and after using this, my skin was more clear and has never looked better!”</span></p><p><span>There’s no question you need this weightless, fast-absorbing formula in your arsenal.

Let those (very valid) worries wash away because all of Merit Beauty’s offerings exclude acne-triggering ingredients—a godsend, indeed. They’re also formulated with the help of celebrity esthetician <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Biba de Sousa</a>, so you know you’re getting thoughtful and reliable formulas.</span></p><p><span>Now, on to the fun part: applying the product. Shake the bottle well and then gently rub two to three pumps onto your face. This should happen after </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>cleansing</span></a><span>, but before </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>moisturizing</span></a><span>. Then, it’s up to you whether you layer on </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>makeup</span></a><span> or go au naturel—do whatever you’re the most comfortable with!</span></p><p><span>If you still need more persuading, tons of shoppers have already flocked to the reviews section to praise this new launch.</span></p><p><span>“Been trying this product for the past week—I am very content [with] how </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>this serum</span></a><span> sits on my face soon as I apply it,” wrote one shopper. “Leaves my skin feeling plumed and glowy instantly. Excited to have this on my new everyday skincare routine! Plus the packaging is to die for.”</span></p><p><span>“This $38 serum is right up there with my $200 serum,” wrote another one. “The pump works well and application of the product is a breeze. It instantly calms and smooths my red and irritated skin leaving me with a glowing glass finish. And the results only get better and better with each passing day. My skin is noticeably more even and hydrated throughout the entire day. This product is hands down a new essential for my regimen.”</span></p><p><span>The verdict is in and it says you should give this </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span><a href=# id=auto-tag_face-serum data-tag=face-serum>face serum</a></span></a><span> a go and watch as your complexion starts to glow in a snap.</span></p><p><span>And if you want to see from the brand, check out some of my fave products.

I can confidently confirm that it adds a beautiful tint to the cheeks. I initially thought Raspberry Beret might be too pigmented and overpowering on my face, but it actually gives me the </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>dewy, sun-kissed glow</span></a><span> that’s super on-trend at the moment.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/merit-beauty-shade-slick-tinted-lip-oil-sangria.png><h2><span>Shade Slick Tinted Lip Oil</span></h2><p><span>I’m a huge </span><a href=#><span>Black Honey</span></a><span> stan, so when I found out TikTokers are using </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Merit Beauty’s tinted lip oil</span></a><span> in Sangria instead of the cult-fave Clinique lipstick, I knew I had to try it for myself.
