 Michael Jackson was physically exhausted from a day of gruelling rehearsals for his marathon 50-night comeback tour. 
But his nightly battle with insomnia had just begun. 
After showering and getting into bed, he called for his 'milk,' a powerful drug he had been using to escape into unconsciousness."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Cherilyn Lee, a nurse nutritionist who treated Jackson with vitamins, said he pleaded unsuccessfully with her to get the drug he knew as Diprivan.<br></span></p><p><span>He said his doctor told him it was safe and he described falling asleep as soon as the drug dripped from an IV into his vein.</span></p><p><span>'I said, "Michael, the only problem with you taking this medication," and I had a chill in my body and tears in my eyes ..., "You're going to take it and you're not going to wake up."'</span></p><p><span>Lee, who said she treated him from January to April 2009, is on the trial witness list. She said she never saw Jackson use other drugs.</span></p><p><span>'He wasn't looking to get high or feel good and sedated from drugs,' she said. 'This was a person who was not on drugs. This was a person who was seeking help, desperately, to get some sleep, to get some rest.'</span></p><p><span>Murray, who had been consulted by Jackson in his Las Vegas office, was promised $150,000 a month when he signed on as Jackson's personal physician six weeks before he died. He closed the doors of his offices there and in Houston to devote himself to the singer.</span></p><p><span>An autopsy report showed that Jackson was generally healthy, indicating his key problem was insomnia.<br></span></p><p><span>Murray has told police he administered other drugs known as benzodiazepines, which are also used as sleep aids. But when they did not work, Jackson demanded Propofol.</span></p><p><span>Murray told police he was trying to wean him from the drug and gave him a minimal dosage, then left the room for five minutes to use the bathroom. However, cell phone records suggest he was making phone calls for a longer time.<br></span></p><p><span>His actions after he found Jackson not breathing are also central to the case.</span></p><p><span>In the two years since Jackson died, doctors have been known to refer to Propofol as 'The Michael Jackson drug.' Some fear a backlash for its use.</span></p><p><span>Dr. Lawrence Koblinksy, head of forensic science at John Jay College in New York, said the situation of a famous man demanding Propofol is an anomaly and should not cast doubt on its effectiveness in hospitals.</span></p><p><span>'If you have a drug that is wonderful, just because a celebrity dies doesn't mean you take it off the market,' he said.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmlpbGFshnZ7rKKaoZmVoXqLrcKkqqimXaO2pLfNmqSenF2kw6a%2Bw6iqnmWUp8Koea%2BrpqmnlqS5brnIpaJmmZ2esW7AzqiiZqaZnLW1esetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
