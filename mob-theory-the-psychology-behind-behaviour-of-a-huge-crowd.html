The decision of this leadership can shape a crowd’s main objection and goal and their level of organization.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>3) Group Identity:</h6><p>The group has a shared sense of identity among the people which unites them together and creates a sense of unity, and solidarity, leading to a strong willingness to work together as one.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>4) Perception of Threat:</h6><p>The belief in a common threat among groups can help the act collectively against their common source of fear.
