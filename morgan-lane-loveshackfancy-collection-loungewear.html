“Morgan would walk over to my house, and we would meet outside and go over prints and styles together,” Cohen tells BAZZAR."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When the longtime friends and founders of sleepwear label Morgan Lane and bucolic dress brand LoveShackFancy realized that they were both sheltering in place down the street from one another in the Hamptons, they decided to join forces on a capsule line of loungewear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Morgan would walk over to my house, and we would meet outside and go over prints and styles together,” Cohen tells BAZZAR.com. “We have such similar aesthetics, and we buy from the same vintage dealers, which made this collaboration so natural and fun. Morgan and her mom both collect and love vintage as much as I do, and we both share a love of everything pink. We had our daughters around, too, as we worked together, which was so special.”</p><img alt="loveshackfancymorgan lane" title="loveshackfancymorgan lane" width=1500 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/8xelwycw-1608050219.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LoveShackFancy/Morgan Lane</span><p>LoveShackFancy and Morgan Lane collection</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The resulting Morgan Lane x LoveShackFancy collection consists of silk pajamas, slipdresses, robes, nightshirts, and eye masks in Cohen’s signature sweet florals. Select styles also come in miniature versions for kids. For both Curtis and Cohen, prolonged time spent at home changed how they looked at their wardrobes every morning. “During lockdown, I found myself wanting to feel comfortable, while still feeling like myself and embracing my creative personality,” says Curtis. “I needed clothing that I could lounge in all day and that would still be acceptable to wear with a pair of sneakers to the store or on a Zoom call.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Accordingly, the two focused on leisurewear, believing that their customers wanted whimsical styles to brighten days that would otherwise feel the same. “We realized that everyone was spending so much time at home in their pajamas, and that luxurious pieces from us both could bring people happiness during this time,” says Cohen. “We became increasingly excited about a capsule of silk pajamas that are fancy and fun to make you feel special at home, but ones that you can also slip on some heels and head out in.”</p><img alt="loveshackfancy and morgan lane collection" title="loveshackfancy and morgan lane collection" width=1500 height=2262 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/msqrjzow-1608050266.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LoveShackFancy/Morgan Lane</span><p>LoveShackFancy and Morgan Lane collection</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A pink princess seam romper, for example, is adorned with three bows on the bust. Pajama tops are cast in dainty floral prints, and their matching bottoms feature ruffles on the hems. And the eye masks are embroidered with playful patterns, including hearts and rainbows. “It is very Marie Antoinette in mood,” explains Cohen. “Imagine delicious cakes and abundant flowers in Versailles. We were also so inspired by Hollywood glamour and drew upon vintage styles from the 1930s and 1940s.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The major shift in dressing habits, from something strictly intended for lounging at home to pieces that can also function outdoors, has been eye-opening for Curtis and Cohen. “We’ve learned a lot from the past almost-year in quarantine and how—now, more than ever—consumers are leaning in to translating comfortable nightwear and lingerie into their everyday.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I will never again underestimate loungewear,” adds Curtis. “This time has made me more deeply appreciate being able to wear clothing that is incredibly covetable, but comfortable to be in at home. Pieces that look good, are easy, but that you can throw on a cozy sweater with and run out the door in. We kept that in mind for the whole collection, and that’s the beauty of this capsule collection.”</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The LoveShackFancy and Morgan Lane Collection<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/761da88f-8b46-4ea7-b5eb-85f2d614da1e_1614118190.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Barry Samaha" title="Headshot of Barry Samaha" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Barry Samaha is the former style commerce editor at Esquire, where he covered all things fashion and grooming.
