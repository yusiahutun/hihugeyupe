The lovely couple gave birth to a daughter and a son.&nbsp;</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/09/naomi-lowde-walked-down-the-aisle-with-jason-priestley--1586442969.jpg width=450 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Naomi Lowde walked down the aisle with Jason Priestley. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Zimbio</strong></span><p>Naomi and Jason met at a crosswalk while waiting for the green light outside the Appollo Theater, London in 2000. It was love at first sight. Soon, the two started dating. After four years of dating, the pair decided to tie the knot and finally get married on May 14, 2005. Their wedding ceremony was celebrated at Beach Ocean Club Resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. Celebrities like <a href=# rel=noopener>Luke Perry</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jennie Garth</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Tori Spelling</a>, and other Priestley's Beverly Hills 90210 fellow actors attended the wedding.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/09/naomi-and-jason-captured-with-kids--1586443095.jpg width=450 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Naomi and Jason captured with kids. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Page Six</strong></span><p>Following two years of their wedding, the lovey-dovey duo was blessed with a daughter, <strong>Ava Veronica Priestley</strong>, on July 2, 2007. Two years later, they welcomed their second-born, a son, <strong>Dashiell Orson Priestley</strong>, on July 9, 2009. The pair frequently share pictures on their respective social accounts, in which they travel to different places with children. So far, there is no sign that the two will get apart.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>The mother of two was born and raised in England. After Jason finished acting in England, she went to New York with the Canadian actor. At that time, the lovey-dovey duo was dating. Since he had to travel a lot for shoots, she needed a complementary job to be with him. So, Lowde enrolled at The School of Makeup Art in Toronto, Canada. After she graduated from there, she started her career as a <a href=# rel=noopener>professional make-up artist</a>. Likewise, Jason's wife frequently worked for the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards and Teens Choice Awards. Furthermore, she did make-up of many models at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2005 and 2006.&nbsp;</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/09/naomi-lowde-is-a-professional-make-up-artist--1586443218.jpg width=450 height=314 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Naomi Lowde is a professional make-up artist. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Zimbio</strong></span><p>Apart from special events, the 45-year-old has done the unique effect make-up in films and worked for the fantastic Halloween makeovers.
