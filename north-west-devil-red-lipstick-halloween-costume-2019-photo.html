Her cousin <strong>Penelope Disick</strong>, 7, also participated in this Heaven and Hell theme in a dress that was half angel, half devil (complete with horns&nbsp;and&nbsp;a halo). The cousins’ friend was also dressed as an angel! <strong>Kourtney Kardashian,</strong> 40, shared a photo of the cute group costume to her Instagram on Oct. 31, writing, “👹 or 👼🏼.” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>You can see a photo of the costumes, here.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s a surprise to see North rocking red lipstick again, since Kanye essentially banned his young daughter from makeup (well, according to <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>). North also wore red lips for the annual Kardashian Christmas Eve party in 2018, and used to rock a number of makeup looks on Kim’s social media accounts — up until recently.&nbsp;“I think [Kanye] had it, he changed all the rules,” Kim, 39, revealed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>&nbsp;at a dinner celebrating the launch of the KKW x WINNIE makeup collaboration in New York City on Sept. 12. Apparently, this even caused tension between Kim and Kanye!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I’d let her wear — you know, she has a little red for Christmas — I’d let her wear a red lip, or I’d let her do one pop of something. I’d let her, if she’s wearing a black dress, a black lip. So, I kind of got in trouble for that,” Kim confessed to E! News.&nbsp;“So, it’s now no more makeup.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The makeup ban was still being enforced when Kim caught up with the outlet for a follow-up interview in October. “North is trying to get in on the makeup but she’s being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager,” Kim revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>&nbsp;at an Ulta Beauty store, which is part of a chain of cosmetics retailers that just started selling KKW Beauty products. Kim still doesn’t exactly see eye-to-eye with Kanye over this matter, because she added, “It’s a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now, but it is what’s best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5xe5JqZqenoqm1bsPErKtmnJWrtq150Z6bZqSZpcC1tcKkZKGZnKG8uLHEp2Scp6Opwq6xjGtnanFdpbWwwM5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
