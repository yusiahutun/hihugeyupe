"I want everybody to see this pictorial and understand that sometimes a whole new phase that's even more exciting than anything you've ever experienced before can happen well over 40."</p><p>The shoot went down in Dominica shortly after filming the latest season of "Top Chef," with the magazine noting she often goes "up two or three sizes" by the end of filming the Bravo cooking competition. That, however, didn't deter her from getting into a bikini.</p><p>"I love where I am in my life and know my body is not perfect by any means, but I feel beautiful. I feel like I have a very lucky, fruitful, productive life. My thighs may have been leaner, and my boobs were probably slightly higher in earlier parts of my life, but I have never felt better about myself," she explained. "I hope they see a full woman in all my facets and nuances and some contradictions. I wouldn't go back to my 20s if you paid me all the money in the world."</p><p>The photos highlight the 7-inch scar on Lakshmi's right arm, something she's come to display proudly on red carpets and TV appearances since a car accident when she was a teenager.</p><p>"Having Helmut [Newton] see me through his eyes and his lens and finding beauty in my scar really was a game-changer for me," she told SI of time modeling in her 20s. "I'm not just saying the light bulb went off and that was it, but when I stopped covering my scar and started wearing it proudly, that was the minute that everything changed."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8d23d6e3-71ea-4601-9cec-40b5a83efced data-container-ref=toofab:article:5447e262-716c-4e89-a6b2-e6c49eb38107 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/70/5by4/2023/01/05/70e4e33db0be40ec8c422712120ab19e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Padma Lakshmi Hits Back at Fan Who Claimed Her Boobs Made Her Daughter Uncomfortable</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I learned a very important lesson as a young woman that beauty is arbitrary, and so is fashion. What's important is that you feel beautiful no matter what," she added. "And that you understand that sometimes your -- I'm not going to say weaknesses -- your obstacles, and overcoming them can often be your strength. I feel more beautiful now because I hold that strength and I hold the experience in my flesh, in my person and in my spirit."</p><p>After sharing a pair of photos from the shoot to her Instagram page, Padma's comments were flooded with messages from her celebrity friends and fans.</p><p>"I fainted," wrote Mindy Kaling, while Tracee Ellis Ross left a series of fire emojis. "wow!!!!!" exclaimed Bridget Moynahan, before Janicza Bravo added, "Need CPR." Sarita Choudhury of "And Just Like That ..." also wrote, "Ummmm wow wowza. Ey Bellaaaaaaaaaa!"</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">See more from her shoot here!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25maWpfpa6lucBmo5qjo526qnnSqaarrKNitq241Kyrq5mkmrFuv9aipKytmal6qr%2FSrpxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
