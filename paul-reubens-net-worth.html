Paul Reubens’ net worth was estimated to be $5 million according to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-comedians/paul-reubens-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>Reubens launched into stardom with his character Pee-wee Herman. The Pee-wee Herman Show was a stage production centered on a fictional character he had been developing for years and ultimately landed him a deal with HBO.</p><p>In 1998, Reubens starred in the<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1620587/what-happened-ishowspeed/ rel="noreferrer noopener"> film</a>&nbsp;Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, directed by Tim Burton, which was released in 1985. The film was a commercial and critical success and to this day, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 87 percent of 46 critics gave it a positive review, with an average rating of 7.85/10. His TV series Pee-wee’s Playhouse earned 22 Emmy Awards during its run and Reubens was nominated for an impressive 14 Emmy Awards.</p><p>He talked about the character’s purpose with <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1357427/paul-rudd-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Rudd</a> in an <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/paul-reubens rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Interview</a> article. “Honestly, most questions that are asked of me about Pee-wee Herman I don’t have a clue on. I’ve always been very careful not to dissect it too much for myself. I love when other people do, but it takes some of the fun out of the work when I have to start figuring out how Pee-wee Herman ticks,” he said. “I never viewed the adult “version” of the show, which was done at midnight and was an homage to ’50s children’s television shows, as solely for adults. I tried to make it so that the act carried over into the version that wound up on CBS on Saturday mornings. And if a kid had seen the original version and caught something in the Saturday morning version, he might be able to laugh at something dirty because he caught the reference. And if a kid didn’t know, it flew right over his head. I always designed things to be dou­ble entendres so it could be appreciated either way.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>&nbsp;Other than his playing his most famous role, he played a drug-dealing hairdresser in the 2001 movie “Blow,” alongside Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to critical acclaim. His TV credits included appearances on<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#> 30 Rock,</a>&nbsp;The Blacklist, and Gotham.</p><p>In 1991, he was arrested for indecent exposure at an adult movie theater, which became somewhat of a popular punchline. But a decade later, Reubens was arrested again—this time for possession of child pornography. His lawyer argued that a tape seized in another case had been mistakenly included in the evidence against Reubens, and three years later, the child pornography charge was dropped, with Rubens pleading guilty to a charge of obscenity instead.</p><p>Even at 70, Reubens still continued to make his character part of him throughout his life. “It dawned on me that I could actually become Pee-wee Herman,” he says. “I could do something that was conceptual art, and the only person who would really know it was conceptual was me.”&nbsp;</p><p>He continued, “People have argued I’ve done everything consciously or unconsciously to destroy [the character],” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “But it’s the brand that won’t die. It’s still around.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lWtnb2ljZL2iwctmqZ6tkpq7tHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
