He was even the People’s sexiest man alive in 2021!</p><p>Over the decades, fans have often wondered how Rudd maintained his good looks without the clear signs of plastic surgery and Botox.</p><p>“I seriously need to know Paul Rudd’s skin care regime because honestly whY DOES THIS MAN NOT AGE?? like im not complaining haha but like omg if I stay half as youthful when im his age ill be basically flawless,” one person wrote on social media.</p><p>Another said: “#PaulRudd is a literal vampire why doesn’t he age?!?!?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-thankfully-he-has-since-answered-those-questions-nbsp>Thankfully, he has since answered those questions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-156119469-1024x694.jpg><p>While appearing alongside his Clueless co-stars at the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo in 2019, the rom-com actor opened up about his skincare routine.</p><p>“I’m 80 years old on the inside,” he joked at the time. “In here, pure darkness.

It is no easy feat.&nbsp;</p><p>He earlier told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Men’s Health</a>: “I get up and I have a cup of coffee, and then I do cardio before I eat anything. I never would’ve done that before [Ant-Man]. I lift weights, hopefully at least three times a week.</p><p>“And I’ve learned so much about how my body reacts to foods, how it reacts to exercise, and where I’m happiest and how much it affects me mentally....If I’m in this suit, running around playing a character who’s supposed to be a superhero, I just feel better. And I feel less like an impostor.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eDcLzArqNmqqWZsW60wKxkm5mimrm6ecCgnJ1lmaN6c4GMspyaqqNirq%2BwjKGgrGWjnrqxuMRmq6uhk6B6uLvNrWSbqpWWuG7Ax55km5meoHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
