So too have the charisma and passion that are hallmarks which have defined Isao Aoki as one of golf’s living legends following an illustrious career.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now 80 years young, Aoki is still in the forefront of the game, serving as chairman of the Japan Golf Tour Organisation. While others his age may prefer a simpler lifestyle, Aoki attends board meetings, plays in tournament Pro-Ams and continues to keep in touch with today’s generation of stars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aoki’s place in the history books lists him as the first Asian and Japanese player to taste victory on the PGA Tour, where this week’s Sony Open in Hawaii marks the 40th anniversary of his 1983 triumph at Waialae Country Club.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Winning the Sony Open was very special … it was a turning point in my lifeIsao Aoki</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His mind is still as sharp as his much-touted short game, and it was that deft touch which helped Aoki produce a memorable victory over Jack Renner some four decades ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the American holding a one-shot clubhouse lead, his Japanese opponent produced a shot for the ages on the 72nd hole, a par-5, by holing out a 128-yard wedge from thick rough for an improbable eagle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a significant milestone for me,” said Aoki, also has 51 Japan Golf Tour wins, one European Tour title and the 1978 World Match Play crown to his name.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was around my 10th year of playing on the international stage and winning the Sony Open represented my motivation and challenging spirit to compete in Europe and the US”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This week’s tournament holds added significance for Japan as Hideki Matsuyama, who became the nation’s first male major winner when he won the Masters in 2021, is the defending champion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/11/1d64c20f-6962-4d85-9423-e9393b96264b_c816e18c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Aoki, Matsuyama also made a glorious eagle on the 18th hole during a playoff against Russell Henley to secure his eighth Tour victory last year. While Aoki holed out with his third, Matsuyama’s heroics came courtesy of a magnificent 3 wood shot which landed three feet from the hole for his winning eagle putt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aoki remembers being transfixed as he watched on television as Matsuyama matched his Hawaiian heroics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think we both left a strong impression in a good way,” Aoki said. “It was extremely touching to hear Hideki say in his speech he was very happy to add his name to the tournament’s history where I had won previously.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whenever the topic turns back to the 1983 Sony Open in Hawaii, Aoki feels a great sense of pride in becoming the first Asian winner on the globe’s elite circuit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Throughout my career, I won a few times in Japan and Europe,” he said. “But winning the Sony Open was very special. Our Japanese nation has idolised Hawaii as the ‘islands of everlasting summer.’ For me to be able to earn a victory there, it was a turning point in my life.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Japanese octogenarian remembers ignoring his caddie’s advice before making the shot that would earn him that win, opting to play a pitching wedge rather than the 9-iron being offered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/11/c19a3299-68d0-4c08-9b78-163312a974bd_838bc663.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was hoping to land the ball between the green edge and the pin for a chance to make birdie [for a play-off],” he said. “Because of this mindset, I was able to make a good swing and the ball went into the cup after one bounce. I also think it was a gift from God.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The fact that I holed out with that club says so much about the amount of adrenaline that was running through my body. Watching it again, it was definitely my best swing ever. I was struggling to hit straight that day so I was hitting the wedge a lot. I felt confident hitting that club, which may have resulted in a hole out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As I made my way up to the green, I was in shock. I remember picking up the ball from the cup in a daze. Maybe I was able to swing my best swing because I had my favourite club in my hands! I still have it [the wedge] with me.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From his years of competing, Aoki is ever ready to share pearls of wisdom with the new generation of Japanese players. He also reiterated the importance of the ‘senpai’ culture among the nation’s golfers. Simply translated, ‘senpai’ means ‘senior’ and is a natural and respectful way of referring to someone who is older or a mentor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While there are struggles in every period of time, I hope everyone finds a way to leave a mark of their own,” he said. “Because of you, there may be a next generation that gets inspired to follow in your footstep. Similar to Hideki reflecting on my victory, I hope the inspiration get passed down from generation to generation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am now 80 years old. As long as you avoid injuries, you can have a very long relationship with the game of golf. I wish to continue to pass down the inspirations for many more players, while maintaining my health.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chuah Choo Chiang is senior director, marketing and communications for the PGA Tour.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2h%2FcYKScGtoqJeWerW71Ktko5mglru0ecismKhlkaS4qnnMmqmkq11pfW7FxJqprGWYnsC1u9GimmagkayuqrWMramirZ2ltW65wJ2cZqCZonqntdGsq2aZo56ur3nPpZiynaJixKq6</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
