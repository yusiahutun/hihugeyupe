Their appearance was to mark a serious occasion of World Mental Health Day on October 10th. However, the Waleses could not help but let loose a little bit.</p><p>US Magazine <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>, that when the hosts Jordan North&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vick Hope asked the duo about their most-used emojis, the Prince, 41, said, “Is this a clean thing or is this a family one?”.</p><p>He then went on to say: “I’ve been told not to say the aubergine, so I’ve got to pick something else.”</p><p>The aubergine refers to eggplant – it’s the British term for the vegetable. Hence, the Prince of Wales’ most used emoji is the eggplant.</p><p>After joking about his answer, he said, “It would have been the aubergine, but I’m saying now — because I’ve got to be all grown up.”</p><p>He then says his answer is “the one where the eyes go up and down and the mouth’s out,” William says. “What’s that one? The slightly crazy one.” However, the hosts could not stop laughing at the Prince’s response.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-s-most-used-emoji-is-more-of-a-safe-choice>Kate’s most used emoji is more of a safe choice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1259076056-1024x683.jpg><p>Unlike her husband, Kate’s response was very family-friendly. The Princess of Wales said: “Mine’s probably going to be the heart with then the crying emoji.”</p><p>She also has another favorite for when things go wrong. “The hysterical laughing when things have gone wrong”, she reveals.</p><p>The couple slightly let loose during their forum in Birmingham, England, where William also shared his tips for mental well-being.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-recently-had-a-cheeky-encounter-of-her-own>Kate recently had a cheeky encounter of her own</h2><p>The Princess recently visited a sports center for a rugby inclusivity day all by herself. She got chatty with the students present.</p><p>In a video by Sky News, we see a “cheeky” student ‘tickling her’ catching the Princess by surprise. Kate jumped up but quickly laughed it off. This is not the first time someone has caught her by surprise.</p><p>During her summer job, <a href=#>Kate was “mortified” after her coworker’s silly prank on her</a>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2Z%2FcLzLmrCfrZxivbO1zZycZq%2BZobmqrcysZKano6l6tr%2FEnWSepZ%2Bftm610qerZq%2BYlsFuxc6um2adqKWypMCMn6mopV2WerO72JqjaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
