The dress turned heads and ruffled some feathers, but it served as yet another statement of Markle's progressively defying royal tradition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alexi Lubormirski, the acclaimed photographer behind the portraits, was "very shocked with the reaction" to the dress, he told <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.etonline.com/meghan-markle-prince-harrys-engagement-photographer-on-the-shocking-response-to-his-shoot-exclusive data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Tonight</a> at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards on Sunday.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the process of how Meghan chose that dress was very simple. "To be honest, we tried on a couple of different things and that was just one that she felt comfortable in, so we weren’t really thinking, ‘Is it nude?’ or anything. We just thought, 'Feel comfortable and let’s make some nice pictures,'" he recalled.<span></span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So there you have it. Meghan wasn't trying to raise eyebrows; she was just being comfortable. (We, too, would like to feel comfortable in couture.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lubomirski also spilled sweet behind-the-scenes details about his time working with Harry and Meghan, who wanted their portraits to be "accessible [and] relatable."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I went to meet them to see if we vibed, they were just cutesy and every time they looked at each other they were like, [giggling],” Lubomirski added to ET. “I was like, ‘This is gonna be great. This is gonna be easy.’ I said, ‘I just want to shoot you like this. This is what you're like."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It looks like we got one of those sweet PDA moments in the finished product:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Surely enough, the actual photoshoot was a breeze for Lubomirski, because his subjects "were so naturally in love." It also helped that both Harry and Meghan were used to being in front of the camera, from his royal duties and her acting career, respectively.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"So, it was wonderful to have her as a sort of coach on set," the photographer described. He kind of led her through and she led him through, and she just made it very nice and easy."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We can only imagine how great their wedding photos will be when they tie the knot on May 19.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Official Engagement Portraits Are Here and They're So Romantic" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/meghanmarkleandprinceharry4-1513979531.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">Want more royals?
