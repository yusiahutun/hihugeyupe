Prince William has been one of the most adored royals since he arrived in this world on June 21, 1982.

However, his stardom grew meteorically in the years following his mother <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s tragic death. Despite him and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> being the face of the British monarchy now, the Prince of Wales’ popularity reached a peak during his gap year in 2000 and his days at St Andrew’s thereafter.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>However, as <a href=#>Netflix</a>‘s The Crown documents the crowned prince’s life, an expert thinks this would all be a bit ‘painful’ for <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-618240520-1024x677.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-crown-shows-prince-william-s-mania-of-the-2000s>The Crown shows Prince William’s ‘mania’ of the 2000s</h2><p>Part two of The Crown’s sixth season starts with an episode entitled Willsmania. It takes us back to the time England’s future king became a sensation across Britain and around the world. In the years following Diana’s death, William rose to heartthrob status.</p><p>Willsmania shows how William began receiving letters from fans (especially girls) around the world in the wake of the former Princess of Wales’ death. It also shows how the Prince’s fans flocked to the streets every time he stepped out for a public engagement. The adoration for the Prince was universal and we witnessed that during <a href=#>King Charles</a>, Prince William, and Prince Harry’s 1998 Canada trip.</p><p>During a confrontation with William, in the episode, Charles confesses that he finds the young Prince’s sudden popularity a “strange” sight for him. The show also addresses the long-standing public opinion that King Charles should abdicate the throne in favor of Prince William to help the monarchy stay “relevant.” Both the Queen and William dismiss the idea as “nonsense” in the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1423734642-1024x725.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-experts-say-it-will-be-painful-for-harry>Experts say it will be ‘painful’ for Harry</h2><p>Royal commentator Tessa Dunlop <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke</a> to Talk TV’s Vanessa Feltz about the show’s new episodes. “We see a lot of William. I think it might be a little bit painful for Harry,” Dunlop states. She notes that the Prince of Wales is shown as a “kind of superstar.”</p><p>“Harry’s gonna be sad. William hogs the limelight here,” the expert says.</p><p>These comments come in the aftermath of Prince Harry’s candid memoir Spare, where he talks about growing up in his big brother’s shadow.</p><p>“Two years older than me, Willy was the Heir, whereas I was the Spare. I was the shadow, the support, the Plan B. I was brought into the world in case something happened to Willy,” he wrote in his explosive autobiography.</p><p>He also stated how he knew his role was to be a “diversion” and “distraction” from his brother and even provide a “spare organ to him.”</p><p>The Invictus Games founder wrote that Charles and William could never travel in the same plane “because there must be no chance of the first and second in line to the throne being wiped out. But no one gave a damn whom I traveled with; the Spare could always be spared,” he wrote.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aDcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZqWRo7aiecinZK2glWKws7vWp2SwoZyheqOxjKmYoqaWqrluss6rZKGZoqfGbsDOZq6arJOdeqbEz56prWWjlsa0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
