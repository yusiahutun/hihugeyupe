In Episode 1 of Married to Medicine Season 10, Quad’s cast mate, Toya, claimed that she had a DUI in between filming Season 9 and Season 10. “I am curious about where she is in her life right now. Because, from what I heard, I was going to ask you—are you covering her DUI case,” Toya asked new cast member and Real Housewives of Atlanta alum Phaedra Parks, who works as an attorney. “No, I don’t know about any DUI charge,” Phaedra said. Toya continued, “Yeah, she got a DUI. I heard about it.”</p><p>When Phaedra asked Toya where she heard that Quad had a DUI, Toya responded, “Girl, this is public knowledge. Quadriyyah Webb. DUI. It’s just the truth.” In a confessional interview, Toya explained, “I’m not one of those people who, when I hear a little gossip, I just run with it. You know, I’m a fact-checker. Look up: DUI. Quadriyyah Webb Lunceford. ” She added referencing Quad’s ex-husband, Dr. Gregory Lunceford, “Forget the Lunceford, that’s somebody else’s name.”</p><p>Back in the scene, Phaedra told Toya, “I’ve never heard that, so I cannot confirm nor deny it.” In her own confessional interview, Phaedra slammed Toya for spreading a rumor about Quad’s DUI without confirmation. “It is nothing nice to be putting a DUI on a Christian woman, and I believe Quad is a Christian woman. I think so.”</p><p>In the scene, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, another Married to Medicine cast member, suggested that Toya should’ve addressed the DUI with Quad, not the group of women. “If that is the case, y’all really need to be checking in on your friend. I haven’t heard from her,” Heavenly said. Gregory’s new wife, Lateasha, then shut down the conversation around Quad. “We’re not going to make this about Quad. If you’re here, you’re here for me and Gregory, but let’s not make that about her,” she said. “Gregory’s more settled in his life. He’s settled with his practice, and he’s ready for a family.”</p><p>So… did Quad get a DUI from Married to Medicine? The answer is unclear, but it seems to be no. According to Distractify, there are no public records that <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Quad had a DUI</a>. If she did, however, Quad wouldn’t be the first Bravolebrity to be arrested for a DUI. Real Housewives of Orange County star Shannon Storms Beador was arrested for for a DUI in September 2023 after she crashed her car in Newport Beach, California, and caused property damage. She was chargged with two misdemeanors by the Orange County District Attorney, including one count of DUI and one count of a hit and run. Law enforcement officers also told TMZ that Shannon had a 0.24 blood alcohol level, which is three times the legal limit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfpsKisIydrKJlnZa%2Fs7XEnWStp12isqW1wqKlnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
