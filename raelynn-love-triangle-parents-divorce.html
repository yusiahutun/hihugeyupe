But there was a time when things weren't so happy -- when she was dealing with her parents' divorce.</p><p>How'd RaeLynn cope with her parents splitting up? Like any good songwriter, she wrote about it. The 20-year-old singer was quick to tell the <a href=#>Boot</a> that she's "very blessed" and leads "an amazing life," but that the divorce brought some heartache (and one very beautiful song).</p><p>“I have an amazing family -- they’re very supportive -- but one thing I have had to go through is, when I turned three, my parents split up,” she explains. “That was really hard on me growing up because I was always that kid stuck in the middle, relaying information back and forth.”</p><p>'The Voice' star is even quick to open up and be honest about how hard it was for her to be put in the middle.&nbsp;“That’s not fair. I mean, they’re grown adults, they shouldn’t be doing that," she admits.</p><p>As fate would have it, one day when RaeLynn was heading to a songwriting session, she received "like, 10 text messages” from her parents. Rather than be down about it, she put all of those difficult feelings into writing 'Love Triangle,' which she recently performed for radio station <a href=#>WYRK</a>.</p><p>“I knew they were arguing about something, and I was really upset, and I almost didn’t go to my writing session that day, but something told me to go,” she says, “and I’m so glad that I did, because I wouldn’t have written this song.”</p><p>Lucky for fans, too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq5mVocavuoylpq%2BdXam%2Fqq3NoKOeZaCWv6a606xknaGmpL%2BksY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
