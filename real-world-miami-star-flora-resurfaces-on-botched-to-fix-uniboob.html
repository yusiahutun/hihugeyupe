The disorder is also referred to as having a "uniboob" and occurs after getting implants.</p><p>"Right now, I'm to the 10th power of anxiety," said Floria in a confessional. "I'm terrified that Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif can't help me. I just want to take a big poop."</p><p>Speaking with the doctors, Flora blamed "stupidity" to her decision to go under the knife. After she give birth, she says her "breasts looked like they could feed the world and then some," so she got them tightened and that's when "they started squaring off."</p><p>She then began doctor shopping and found one who tried to fix the problem, but that didn't work. As she described it, her "boobs were getting closer." Hearing about her case, the doctors were both shocked to hear she had been put under "twilight anesthesia" for her last procedure, a type of anesthesia where patients don't completely lose consciousness.</p><p>According to Dr. Dubrow, fixing Symmastia should never be done under twilight anesthesia, because, "Number one its incredibly painful and, number two is really hard to do when the patient is awake."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e930c918-63ee-5235-b1a0-5d796ce19078 data-container-ref=toofab:article:29f83133-7af7-511d-a2a0-a14587761fb8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4c/5by4/2018/06/20/4cb19a8b907351ab918936cf560d7057_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">See 'Real World: New Orleans' Star Danny Roberts NOW -- as He Spills on PTSD and His Big WWHL Regret</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>On the day of her surgery, Dubrow said that if they couldn't fix the Symmastia, it may be time to say enough with implants altogether. His plan was to remove her implants, put in smaller ones, while tightening and removing excess skin to give her two "full healthy breasts."</p><p>During the operation, however, he came across a big surprise. "I'm met with a surprise, a white substance that looks exactly like bird poop on the windshield," he explained. What was it? A type of abdominal mesh used for hernias, which is what ended up pushing her breasts together.</p><p>During a follow-up with Flora, Dubrow explained what he found. "I'm so furious," she exclaimed in a confessional. "The doctor used something foreign that he wasn't supposed to use on my breasts. I'm f—king pissed."</p><p>She, however, was thrilled with Dubrow's work, as he said he was "cautiously optimistic" she wouldn't once again get a uniboob,</p><p>"I'm giving Dr Dubrow a round of applause," she said. "Everybody meet Thelma & Louise, hopefully they won't drive off a cliff together!"</p><p>"Botched" airs Mondays on E!</p><a id=gallery-link-836f2c0f-dfcf-5cfd-9bf3-572bff467c48 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:836f2c0f-dfcf-5cfd-9bf3-572bff467c48 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20190613_88e1a4e978e55e35af61bfb72207a3a6 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:29f83133-7af7-511d-a2a0-a14587761fb8 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/88/4by3/2019/06/13/88e1a4e978e55e35af61bfb72207a3a6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j2xmam5fp7KiuIywpquklGK6qq3MomSsrJGneqe4zquYZqqVqMKzssCcnKxln6N6o7vTnJ%2BenF2pvG6yyLFkrqaZl7ywro4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
