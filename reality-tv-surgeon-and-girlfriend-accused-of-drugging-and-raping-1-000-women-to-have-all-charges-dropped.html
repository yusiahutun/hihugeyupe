The couple who were accused of raping and drugging multiple women — and then were told the charges would be dropped because they were fabricated by a DA for media attention — are back in court on the same charges again.
Grant Robicheaux and Cerissa Riley appeared at a hearing on Thursday, as Judge Frank Ospino heard arguments from attorneys for the defense, prospection and alleged victims, as the topsy-turvey case made its way back into the courtroom once again."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Defense attorneys accused him of showing bias, which he denied. He also denied their motion to get rid of him, claiming they made the application too late. Nevertheless, he decided to step aside anyway, handing it over to Judge Ospino.</p><p>Prosecutors had told Bromberg they wanted the charges to be reduced to one alleged victim, but told Opsino they would center their case on two.</p><p>One of the alleged victims told the court on Thursday she was "exhausted" by the three years of twists and turns; another told the judge the case was "a complete travesty."</p><p>"I've begged a judge not to dismiss my case," the alleged victim — who is not part of the criminal filing — told the court, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>. "I told Robicheaux I didn't want to have sex with him."</p><p>Robicheaux is currently charged in connection with five alleged victims, and Riley with three.</p><p>Judge Ospino said he expects to rule next week on whether or not he will allow the charges to be reduced.</p><p>The lawyer representing the five women, Matt Murphy, blamed the DA's office for making a mess of the case.</p><p>"From the victims' perspective, responsibility for the contentious nature of this litigation lies squarely with a district attorney who continues to place his own political self-interests above the rules of ethics and the rights of victims," he wrote, himself a former senior deputy district attorney.</p><p>The DA's office fired back: "Mr. Murphy continues to make unfounded allegations in this case. Instead of his spurious, self-serving declarations, we look forward to hearings under oath in a court of law."</p><p>Although Spitzer is no longer officially involved in the case, Murphy accused him of repeatedly trying to shoehorn himself back in.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">update 2/5/2020 8:40 AM</p><p>A reality TV surgeon and his girlfriend are being cleared of drugging and raping 1,000 women.</p><p>Prosecutors in California announced they were dropping all charges against 39-year-old Grant Robicheaux and Cerissa Riley, 33, after determining there was "no provable evidence" that the pair "committed any sexual offense."</p><p>The District Attorney Todd Spitzer accused his predecessor Tony Rackauckas of manufacturing details about the case and repeatedly misstating evidence in order to garner headlines just to promote his re-election campaign.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5953e8eb-206a-5044-964d-0981ff7198b7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6cf92516-280d-5dca-9cb3-4c412d6a6483 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3b/5by4/2020/01/31/3b4c5a72da3f565995caabd687e37492_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Harvey Weinstein Has No Testicles and Appears to Have a Vagina, Rape Accuser Testifies</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In September 2018, Rackauckas filed charges against the couple, accusing them of sexually assaulting two women. The first woman claimed she had met the pair in a restaurant in April of 2016, and was "escorted" while intoxicated back to their apartment, where she was given multiple drugs and raped. The second woman claimed she met them in a bar in October of that year, had drank with them until she was unconscious and awoke to find them sexually assaulting her.</p><p>Rackauckas said that during the investigation, authorities seized videos from the couple's phones showing as many as 1,000 incapacitated victims had been taken advantage of.</p><p>His prosecutors claimed they preyed on victims at bars and festivals, such as the Man in Black Rock Desert, Nevada, the Dirtybird Campout Festival in Silverado, California, and the Splash House music festival in Palm Springs; following press conferences appealing for more alleged victims to come forward, six more did.</p><p>Robicheaux and Riley were charged with 17 felony counts each, including rape by use of drugs, and assault with intent to commit a sexual offense, and faced life imprisonment if convicted.</p><p>They pled not guilty, insisting all encounters were consensual.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c0/o/2020/02/05/c05cd05889f75f8e955431aa189e0262_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">AP</span><p>'We unequivocally deny all allegations of non-consensual sex and absolutely deny any allegations that we have ever secretly drugged anyone for the purpose of having sex with them," they said in a statement at the time. "We have both passed polygraph tests on each of the questions and we look forward to the truth coming out."</p><p>"We didn't flee, we didn't move and we didn't go into hiding," they said. "Before our arrests in this case, we had great friends, great lives and great careers that allowed us to make positive contributions to our community. We look forward to getting our lives back. We have and will continue to stay here to clear our names we worked hard to establish."</p><p>Spitzer, who defeated Rackauckas in the November 2018 election for Orange County DA, ordered a review of the case after his predecessor admitted in a deposition given June 2019 "that he had used the case to garner media attention to help his re-election campaign."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:30551ee4-f54b-5e77-b641-667d9305f0a6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6cf92516-280d-5dca-9cb3-4c412d6a6483 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4d/5by4/2020/02/02/4dfd1828f90e546199423da6432a0fdb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bella Hadid Among Those Named as Victim in Victoria's Secret Sexual Harassment Report</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>During the three month review, investigators sifted through thousands of videos, photographs, documents, text messages and audio recordings covering a four year period — and found no evidence of sexual assault.</p><p>"There is not a single piece of evidence or video or photo that shows an unconscious or incapacitated woman being sexually assaulted," Spitzer said. "Not one."</p><p>"In fact, the review revealed that there was not a single independent witness who came forward to say they saw the defendants sexually assault an unconscious woman."</p><p>He said that what the prior district attorney and his chief of staff did to the defendants and to the women involved in this case was "a travesty".</p><p>"My sworn duty as the elected district attorney is not to secure convictions," he said in a statement.
