Jill, who was on &#34;RHONY&#34; from Season 1 through 4, lost her husband in January of this year after he lost his nearly 9-year battle with thyroid cancer. Bethenny, who had a falling out with Jill in 2011, booked a private plane from Aspen to New York to be by her once-BFF's side as soon as she heard the news."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Despite what's happened with Jill, Bobby loved me, and I loved him... I'm going to Bobby's funeral for Jill."</p><p>Bethenny attended the funeral, but she found herself lingering outside after the service.</p><p>"I thought I was gonna go in and leave, so I don't know why I'm not leaving!" she explained during a confessional. "I just feel like I wanna see her again. I'm feeling badly, I mean, not about our relationship, just about a woman who lost her husband. Like, a loss. I mean, they've been married for all these years. Like, that's a real loss no matter what. They were together all the time."</p><p>When Jill made her way outside, Bethenny went in for a hug and said, "I just -- I couldn't leave. I don't know why. I couldn't leave."</p><p>"Bobby's here," Jill replied, wiping away tears. "He's still here."</p><p>"What're you gonna do now?" Bethenny asked, also wiping away tears.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:503ce046-94d9-590f-b60b-1badd9b32cc7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ffa4d1f2-cb6b-57ff-8aba-fa36fb47a0e2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/48/5by4/2018/05/30/48a547b6f01956d08c2c5a706d95a96b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'RHONY' Bad Apple of the Week: Bethenny Frankel Manages to Tick Off Almost All of Her Costars</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I'm so proud of you," Jill said. "I just have to tell you, Bobby loved you. Really."</p><p>"I know," Bethenny said repeatedly. "I'm sorry. It didn't hit me until yesterday. It's like, he's not here. He's supposed to be next to you."</p><p>"I'm alone now," Jill replied. "I don't know what to do without him. I don't know what to do without him. What am I gonna do? I've never been alone since I'm 20 years old."</p><p>"But you have good friends. I'm alone, too," Bethenny said before she cracked a joke about how there were no "gift bags" at the service. "What kind of funeral is this? It's a terrible funeral!" she joked. Jill laughed, and the two parted ways.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9aeb7d53-ef25-559d-b306-6b3bd48407cb data-container-ref=toofab:article:ffa4d1f2-cb6b-57ff-8aba-fa36fb47a0e2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b9/5by4/2018/05/23/b9f7c832b7d85ef48fdaa14f30f702d5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'RHONY' Bad Apple of the Week: Dorinda Ignites Screaming Match Between Bethenny and Carole</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"During the funeral, they kept saying, 'Bobby would never tell Jill no,'" Bethenny said during her confessional. "So it's so ironic that the one time Bobby's ever told her no was when she told him to fix it with me. And Bobby said, 'No, you're gonna have to learn the lesson on your own. You were wrong.' But in the end, Bobby did fix it -- 'cause it was his funeral."</p><p><strong><a href=#>Ramona Singer</a></strong> also set aside her issues with Jill and made amends with her former co-star when Bobby's health took a turn.</p><p>"Once I found out Bobby was really, really sick, I really didn't care -- I said I'm going to visit her and Bobby," Ramona said. "And Jill and I had this heart-to-heart talk for about 45 minutes. And we cried and we hugged and we talked, and whatever distension I had with her before or she had with me, we said we're gonna let it go because life is too short. And our relationship made a major shift because of that. You can't hold resentments."</p><p>"What I really loved about Bobby is he lived to make Jill happy," she added. "If Jill was happy, he was happy, and I hope one day maybe I'll be as lucky as Jill to find a man like that."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cf6cdce2-5161-535c-84ae-635a1c799fb5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ffa4d1f2-cb6b-57ff-8aba-fa36fb47a0e2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/44/5by4/2018/05/17/44112812c8d95762b996b9703e36c464_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why 'Shahs of Sunset' Star MJ Thinks NeNe Leakes Is Bravo's Biggest Diva and Ramona Singer Is 'Awful'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong><a href=#>Dorinda Medley</a></strong> -- who also attended the funeral and also lost a husband to cancer -- had only positive things to say about Jill's late husband.</p><p>"A man like Bobby, in my mind, he was like a Richard," she said. "And I'll tell ya -- it's a loss to the world 'cause they don't make them like that anymore. They don't."</p><p>"When you really realize that they ain't getting out of this -- just going through it myself -- there comes a point where, you know, poor Bobby held out for a long time," Dorinda added. "At some level -- and I know no one understands this -- it's a relief for Jill."</p><p>"The Real Housewives of New York" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><a id=gallery-link-90575a61-c2b2-5c43-9156-a189b1296703 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:90575a61-c2b2-5c43-9156-a189b1296703 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20180607_6d93b2ca1d315e08b10ad56b383ee2cc data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ffa4d1f2-cb6b-57ff-8aba-fa36fb47a0e2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6d/4by3/2018/06/07/6d93b2ca1d315e08b10ad56b383ee2cc_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j29mamtfp7WwuthmmZ6smJq7r8WMn6mappuauW6ywJycrGWanrmtedmaqaKmXZe8o67YZp2uppWnrq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
