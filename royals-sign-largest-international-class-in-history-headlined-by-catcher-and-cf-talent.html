But there’s a flipside.
In that same class, no international player signed for more money than Yadier Alvarez, a Cuban pitcher who has not risen above Double A in the Los Angeles Dodgers’ system."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That trio alone has amassed 40 wins above replacement at the big-league level.</p><p>Those players demonstrate the potential of international free agency.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>But there’s a flipside.</p><p>In that same class, no international player signed for more money than Yadier Alvarez, a Cuban pitcher who has not risen above Double A in the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Los Angeles Dodgers</a>’ system. Jhailyn Ortiz, an outfielder from the Dominican Republic who signed for a reported $4 million with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Philadelphia Phillies</a>, also has not eclipsed Double A.</p><p>Hence why Rene Francisco, the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Royals</a>’ senior vice president of major league and international operations, said bluntly Tuesday afternoon: “This process is so difficult.”</p><p>The Royals had earlier in the day announced their 2022 international signing class of 28 players, which marked the largest international free-agent class in franchise history. The group boasts 12 right-handed pitchers, four left-handed pitchers, four outfielders, four shortstops, two catchers, one third baseman and one first baseman.</p><p>In explaining the Royals’ approach to this class, Francisco drifted back to the talent of 2015 and how it highlighted the difficulty of this process. Projecting the baseball future of teenagers is challenging in itself. Other factors are at play, some of which <a href=#>The Athletic outlined in a recent story</a>. In general, the scouts and club personnel who evaluate prospective international signees have to make quick decisions. When you’re investing potentially millions of dollars — again, on the future of raw teenagers — that’s a tough task.</p><p>The Royals have made those snap judgments in the past. In 2019, they signed left-handed-hitting outfielder Erick Peña to a reported $3.8 million deal. Last year, the Royals came to terms with toolsy shortstop Daniel Vazquez on a reported $1.5 million contract. This year, the Royals signed known talents but also spread their $6,262,600 bonus pool around.</p><p>The club focused heavily on athletic talent but also sought to identify players with impressive hitting approaches and skills. As for the bevy of pitchers in this Royals class, Francisco pointed to the pitching development acumen of Dominican Academy field coordinator Victor Baez. He also cited the club’s perspective on pitching.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“In every trade, you trade pitching,” Francisco said. “It’s a very (big) commodity. You have to have pitching.”</p><p>Overall, Francisco attributed the credit for this class to assistant general manager of international operations Albert Gonzalez, coordinator of Latin American scouting Orlando Estevez, manager of international operations Fabio Herrera and loads of international scouts and cross-checkers.</p><p>That brings us to a breakdown of the Royals’ most high-profile signings, with help from Francisco:</p><h3>Juan David Olmos, catcher (Colombia)</h3><p>The Royals have known about Olmos for years, and here’s why: Olmos’ uncle, Rafael Miranda, has been scouting with the Royals in Colombia for more than a decade. The makings of what would become a 6-foot-3 frame were evident to the scout early on. As his nephew grew, the Royals recognized that the strength was starting to seep through. So they set out to sign him.</p><p>Francisco brought up a comparison for Olmos that many reporters have used: <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Salvador Perez</a>. In some ways, it’s understandable — the Royals, who boast one of the game’s best catchers from Latin America, signed another catcher from Latin America with potential. Francisco said it’s unfair to put such a hefty tag on a young player, whom <a href=#>MLB.com reported signed for $800,000</a>. But he explained the true reason others use the comparison.</p><p>“Because of the size,” Francisco said. “He’s strong. He does have a similar build to Salvy at the same age. That, I can tell you.”</p><h3>Erick Torres, center fielder (Dominican Republic)</h3><p>Connections run deep among baseball folks in the international market. This was the case with the Royals and Sandy Nin, who trains many athletes in the Dominican Republic. Nin was a scout for the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Miami Marlins</a> and signed players such as <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marcell Ozuna</a>. Royals assistant general manager of international operations Albert Gonzalez is a former Marlins scout. The point: The Royals had familiarity with players in Nin’s program such as Torres, a center fielder who hits and throws right-handed.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Francisco scouted Torres alongside Royals Dominican Republic scouting supervisor Edis Perez.</p><p>“I like this kid,” Perez told Francisco, referencing a build somewhat similar to that of Raúl Mondesi Sr.</p><p>Francisco wanted to make sure the Royals were solid in their evaluation, so they observed him for a few more months and ultimately decided to sign him.</p><h3>Henry Ramos, center fielder (Dominican Republic)</h3><p>One of the Royals’ scouts, in checking out Torres, turned the team onto Ramos, who also played in Nin’s program. Ramos, opposite of Torres, is a center fielder who hits and throws left-handed.</p><p>Multiple scouts spent time evaluating Ramos and agreed: They should sign him, too. And they did, for <a href=#>a reported $800,000</a>.</p><p>“He can run,” Francisco said. “He can throw. And when I say he has power for a young kid, it’s pretty good.”</p><h3>Josi Navas, shortstop (Dominican Republic)</h3><p>In the international signing sphere, scouts know names such as Olmos, Torres and Ramos. Then there are players such as Navas who pop up late. In the fall, Francisco showed up to an open workout in the Dominican Republic and surveyed the field. One 6-foot-2, 170-pounder stood out.</p><p>“His body,” Francisco said. “His smile. His arm strength. The hands.”</p><p>Navas fielded groundballs. He also stepped up to the plate for some at-bats and further impressed Francisco with how advanced he was in his approach. The Royals decided to sign him. Then one day at the Royals’ academy in the Dominican Republic a few weeks later, Francisco pointed him out to Royals president of baseball operations Dayton Moore.</p><p>“And this kid put on a show that day,” Francisco said. “He hit balls far in batting practice. It was impressive. He had a lot of energy.”</p><p>Navas’ body, Francsico said, resembles a young Miguel Sano, who signed with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Minnesota Twins</a> in 2009 for a reported $3.15 million.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3>Charles Nova, shortstop (Dominican Republic)</h3><p>Nova, Francisco said, was born in the United States. Nova’s parents, though, moved to the Dominican Republic while Charles was young because of his father’s business. When Charles was a boy, his father built him a field. The opportunity to play turned the kid into what Francisco described as “a baseball rat.”</p><p>“He’s not very big in stature,” Francisco said. “But he’s a middle infielder who has a really good feel to hit from the right side.”</p><h3>Manuel German, first base (Dominican Republic)</h3><p>The Royals rarely sign big-framed, corner infielders in the international market, but German carries some interesting traits.</p><p>He’s the cousin of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who led the majors in home runs last year.</p><p>“And I say that because this kid has some juice in his bat,” Francisco said. “And it’s kind of like the same body as his cousin.”</p><p><strong>Other signees: </strong>RHP Andy Basora (Dominican Republic), RHP Carlos De La Rosa (Dominican Republic), LHP Jesus Franco (Mexico), LHP Agustin Herrera (Mexico), RHP Henson Leal (Venezuela), RHP Yuniol Marte (Dominican Republic), C Jose Medina (Venezuela), CF Raimer Medina (Dominican Republic), RHP Swandrick Oduber (Aruba), SS Alexander Orasma (Venezuela), LHP Juan Ozuna (Dominican Republic), SS Angel Pierre (Dominican Republic), RHP Yimi Presinal (Dominican Republic), RHP Emmanuel Reyes (Dominican Republic), LHP Edinson Salgado (Colombia), RHP Junior Sanchez (Dominican Republic), RHP Jeremy Santos (Dominican Republic), SS Ivan Sosa (Dominican Republic), CF Luis Tejeda (Dominican Republic), RHP Luis Valdez (Dominican Republic), RHP Richi Valdez (Dominican Republic), RHP Pineda Werner (Dominican Republic)</p><p>(Photo of Erick Torres: Courtesy of the Kansas City Royals)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57kmlwa21lZ3xzfJFrZmlpX2eCcL7Ospilq12otqi6jKWYq5%2BVqMFutc2tnKumkam2sLrApWScpJGowG61zWafoqukpL%2B6eceemJ2kmaOypXnBsmScmaSYtaa%2BjJqlnWWTm3q1rcuepa1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
