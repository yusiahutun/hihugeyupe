On Friday June 9, 2023, the popular weather forecaster wore a gleaming white pair of shoes while discussing the Canadian wildfire smoke situation in the US.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Sam Champion appears in his sneakers on GMA on Friday</figure><p id=eOFXRAlmHg7u data-wc=49>"Good morning Sam, I love your outfit on the show today," tweeted one fan in response to Sam's first report. Another later wrote that Sam was "looking marvelous" while a third person penned under a tweet from the show's account: "Please, have Sam Champion full time!!! He’s the best!!"</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><p id=eMtqXJwtmycM data-wc=43>However, in late May 2023 one viewer was less than impressed with Sam's outfit coordination. "Will someone buy Sam Champion on @GMA a pair of black sneakers?" they tweeted humorously, explaining: "I can’t with the jet black everything then the blinding white shoes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/5636983cc1bf-sam-champion-controversial-style-1.jpg><p id=edsbz7a3cex9 data-wc=55>Debate on the issue actually goes back to Sam's early years on the show, as one tweet from 2009 reveals. "On GMA today...Sam Champion wearing a suit and a pair of tennis shoes. That's awesome in my books!!" wrote one fan on the social media site. However, they also added: "GMA, buy Sam some shoes!"</p><p id=empkG5vaxBl data-wc=13><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>GMA's Sam Champion delivers 'wild and wonderful' update during vacation with husband</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fb4bb82a7570-sam-champion-controversial-style.jpg><p id=e3OsLIe9E8z5 data-wc=45>A quick search on the site proves fans have been commenting on the controversial fashion choice throughout the years. "Sam Champion wearing tennis shoes with his suit today on GMA...c'mon Sam, ur not a 20 something or a hipster," said one person in March 2018.</p><p id=eaeCFDySzC data-wc=13><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>ABC stars rally around beloved GMA colleague as he awaits medical procedure</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e8020cb5dbee-sam-champion-controversial-style-4.jpg><p id=eWTPA9PuiqFn data-wc=53>The constant comments which have poured in over this unorthodox on-air fashion choice at least reflect how Sam has been consistent in his choice to wear the sneakers all along. Undoubtedly, the famous weather host knows what he likes and has stuck to it – a commendable fact, especially given all the criticism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/76edff98c03d-sam-champion-controversial-style-2.jpg><p id=eHZuHDIQZL data-wc=83>Without a doubt, Sam is unbothered by some people's attempts to dissuade him from pairing the bright white shoes with his suits. However, the weather forecaster did find it harder to accept that his recent holiday with his family and GMA cast friends had to <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>come to an end</a></strong>. Taking to the social media platform with a photo of him lounging at their Turks and Caicos based home this weekend, the weather host explained that their downtime together had gone by "too fast".</p><p id=eLmyLU7Ktce data-wc=80>"What if we just sat here for a few extra days…. Right here…." he wrote, before adding: "What an incredible trip… and it all went too fast." It was clear his friends felt the same super positive way about <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>their trip away</a></strong>, with <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Robin Roberts</a></strong> commenting on his post: "Loved spending time with you and our travel squad…true friendship." Meanwhile <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Gio Benitez</a></strong>'s husband Tommy DiDario collated a video of various moments from their trip for a cute celebratory Instagram reel.</p><p id=eWbrsTEk_zhQ data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
