They share two children, son Pip, 7, and <a href=#>Margot</a>, 5.</p><p>“Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another, whilst we continue to raise our family together,” Claflin<a href=#> wrote in a statement</a> via Instagram Story at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sam-clafin-laura-haddock.jpg><p>Now, more than three years later, the Me Before You star reflected on the early days as a divorcée and a single dad. He explained to Variety: “I think I needed to work out a few kinks in my own life, to figure out who I was as this dad on my own in a house outnumbered by two toddlers. Then this job coming out the back of that was just the most fun, joyous fresh start.”</p><p>Prime Video’s Daisy Jones & the Six follows a 1970s rock band’s rise to fame and sudden breakup. Claflin plays lead singer Billy, who marries his hometown sweetheart, Camila (<a href=#><strong>Camila Morrone</strong></a>), and welcomes a daughter amid his drug and alcohol addiction. As he tries to keep his substance abuse under control and his family together, he starts working with singer Daisy Jones (<a href=#><strong>Riley Keough</strong></a>). Their lighting-in-a-bottle chemistry could make his band the best — and make his marriage fall apart.</p><p>Claflin couldn’t relate to Billy’s struggles with drugs and alcohol, but he certainly knew what it was like to struggle as a spouse and parent. “I was a husband. I’ve been through marriage and the struggle of juggling work, family life, home and being grounded,” he said. “The obstacles he has to overcome, like becoming a dad and the fear or anxiety that brings, feeling like you might fail. … His fear of failure is something that I can massively relate to — needing to feel approval and the fear of abandonment. I’ve been through this struggle. And I’m sure the struggle will continue.”</p><p>However, he believes <a href=#>Daisy Jones & the Six </a>helped him get through the roughest part of his split. He was cast just a few months after he and Haddock confirmed their divorce, and the five-week prep for the drama turned into a year and a half amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think my relationship with myself is a lot better than it was,” Claflin said. “Before, I didn’t like who I was or what I had to say. Whereas now, after going through the journey of Billy Dunne, I realize how therapeutic or cathartic it was to tell a story that feels really authentic to me. It allowed me the opportunity to approach life differently.”</p><p>Prime Video’s Daisy Jones & the Six premieres Friday, March 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasmZ1isK2txaWgp2WimrCiuMusZJqcmqrAtbXNoGStp12otq%2Bzy55kn5mknbKztM6om2aZnZ6xbrDIr6arm5Vk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
