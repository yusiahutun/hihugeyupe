But she seems to have pinged right back into shape,<strong> flaunting her slim physique in a tight-fitting halter-neck dress</strong> from Preen's Spring 2015 collection. The quirky black dress featured red and white trim and fringing. Scarlett accessorised with a pair of classic black heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/68d6bf15d300-scarlett-2-a.jpg><p id=erbahOC6RSbT data-wc=12><strong>Scarlett was showing off her enviable post-baby physique in a tight-fitting dress</strong></p><p id=en3fANGfljod data-wc=65>She kept her jewellery to a minimum, sporting a simple black bracelet and pearl earrings. A slick of peach lipstick completed the look. Scarlett walked the red carpet with Chris Hemsworth, her co-star. She presented the excellence in film award to Chris during the ceremony at the 2015 G'Day USA Gala and Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts International Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/410ec71bc410-scarlett-3-a.jpg><p id=e-8oNcOhpuJm data-wc=11><strong>The actress was presenting an award to her co-star Chris Hemsworth</strong></p><p id=e2t02rLCSze4 data-wc=142>"He's all at once sensitive and ferocious, otherworldly and grounded, is shockingly handsome and is surprisingly approachable," Scarlett said of her co-star before handing him the award. "He is every man and like no man you've met before. He is versatile despite his physicality, which makes him a grade A movie star." Scarlett recently opened up about her new role of motherhood. "It's wonderful. It's very, very magical – and exhausting," she told People. "The love is just unbelievable. It's very overwhelming," she added of her connection with her baby . While the blonde beauty has previously admitted that she is still learning the ropes, Scarlett has thrown herself into her new role and seems more than happy to be on diaper duty and to do the late-night feeds. "[I do] the whole bit," she said. "I'm nursing and I love it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGlpaWVlf3F%2BlGxscWpfqLCivsueq61lmqS1orrSrKanZZ6axG651KZkp52nYrWitdFmmq6sXai1osLEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
