These two seem to glow anytime, anywhere—and for good reason. They both swear by the same scientist-backed skincare line that consists of products made with traditional Japanese botanicals and clinical ingredients. And it seems like <a href=# id=auto-tag_selena-gomez data-tag=selena-gomez>Selena Gomez</a> is taking a page out of their books.</p><p>The award-winning actress, singer and <a rel=noopener href=#>beauty founder</a> told&nbsp;<a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Vogue UK</a>&nbsp;that she relies on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tatcha moisturizers and cleansers</a> to keep her skin as healthy as possible.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>“I love <a href=# id=auto-tag_tatcha data-tag=tatcha>Tatcha</a>,” she said. “I think a lot of their moisturizers and face washes are gentle, but also extract all the nasty stuff.”</p><p>Now, specifically for her combination dry and oily skin, Gomez reaches for the brand’s coveted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dewy Skin Cream</a>, a plumping <a href=# id=auto-tag_moisturizer data-tag=moisturizer>moisturizer</a> that’s known for its noticeable anti-aging benefits. This isn’t a new item in her skincare arsenal, though. In fact, she’s been using the product for years. She told&nbsp;<a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Vogue</a>&nbsp;back in 2020 that she uses the Dewy Skin Cream before putting on a full face of makeup, and added that “it’s so thick and yummy that you actually don’t have to use that much of it.”</p><p>Lucky for you, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tatcha’s friends and family sale</a> is discounting everything on the brand’s site by 20 percent. All you have to do to get this moisturizer for $56 instead of $70 is enter code <strong>FRIEND23</strong> before the sale ends on June 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dewy-skin-cream.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$56</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$70</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>20% Off</span></p><p>There are a few major players in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moisturizer</a> that, combined, make up a seriously beneficial skin treatment (specifically for mature skin): Japanese purple rice, Okinawa algae, hyaluronic acid and botanical extracts.</p><p>Rice? In a moisturizer? You bet, babe. Purple rice is packed to the brim with rich nutrients and antioxidants that can actually help your skin protect itself against pollution. This makes sense since the ingredient itself has to survive (and thrive) in harsh environments. Okinawa algae and hyaluronic acid combine together to create the moisturizing duo of your dreams. Rich in ceramides that build back your skin barrier, this combo is also an impressive plumping agent.</p><p>As for botanicals, ingredients like ginseng and thyme combine to moisturize your skin so deeply that they can actually help it retain and release moisture, creating a dewy glow. Thus, the name!</p><p>More than 3,000 shoppers have given this skin-saver an average <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">4.8-star rating</a>, which, in the skincare world, is unheard of. They credit the nourishing product for diminishing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, while also combating dry and flaky skin at the same time.</p><p>“Before, my skin [was] extremely dehydrated, dull. Due to my working outside in the elements in all its glory, you can see my <span class=highlight-text>wrinkles</span> from miles away,” wrote one five-star reviewer. “But as soon as I use this product, my skin is plump, hydrated without being greasy. It doesn’t clog my pores. Also, my skin is glowing AND my&nbsp;<span class=highlight-text>wrinkles</span> aren’t nearly as visible!”</p><p>Starting at $22, you can <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dewy Skin Cream</a> in three sizes ranging from a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">10 mL travel one</a> to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">75 mL bulk one</a>. If, like Gomez, you want to improve your skincare routine and give your face some love, this is the item for you.</p><p>“When I was younger, I didn’t really take care of my skin,” Selena admitted in her&nbsp;Vogue video. Now, however, her outlook is all-encompassing. &nbsp;“When you are taking care of your skin, you’re taking care of your mind and your body and your soul,” she said.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but my mind, body and soul could use a good <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Dewy Skin Cream</a>.
