Their penalty shootout exit adds to an already impressive collection of unexpected results from this tournament, with Saudi Arabia's win over Argentina and Japan's victory over Germany in the group stages some of the standouts.</p><p>But, the quarter-final stage is where the real tension begins, with each game treated like the final itself. England face a tough test against defending champions France, Argentina and Netherlands go head to head in a battle of titans, strong favourites Brazil face 2018 finalists Croatia and dark horses Morocco take on an in-form Portugal side.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>UFC star Paddy Pimblett explains why he has snubbed England and World Cup 2022 in Qatar</b></a></p><p>So, what could happen in the 2022 World Cup quarter-finals, and who could go on to win the competition?

We then simulated all the knockout stages of the competition, and this is what happened.</p><p><b><i>Who do you think will win the 2022 FIFA World Cup? Let us know in the <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>comments section</a> below!</i></b></p><h4><span>Quarter-finals:</span><br></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28679283.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_world-cup-quarter-finals.jpg><ul><li><b>Brazil 1-0 Croatia (AET)</b></li><li><b>Netherlands 3-4 Argentina (AET)</b></li><li><b>Portugal 4-2 Morocco</b></li><li><b>England 1-0 France</b></li></ul><p>The standout clash in the quarter-finals was between the Netherlands and Argentina, with Lionel Messi's dream staying alive after a dramatic 4-3 win in extra time. Both sides went down to 10 men in 90 minutes, but it was Lautaro Martinez's extra-time strike that helped his side to the next round.</p><p>England were impressive defensively once again as the Three Lions booked their spot in the semis with a 1-0 win over defending champions France. Bukayo Saka scored the only goal of the game in a narrow victory for Gareth Southgate's side.</p><p>Morocco took a shock 2-0 lead against Portugal in their quarter-final match-up, but the European side proved too powerful, scoring four to come from behind and win the game. Brazil just about scraped through to the quarter-finals against Croatia, with Fabinho scoring in the 119th minute of the game to secure a 1-0 win.</p><h4>Semi-finals:</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28679297.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_world-cup-semi-finals.jpg><ul><li><b>Argentina 2-3 Brazil (AET)</b></li><li><b>England 2-1 Portugal (AET)</b></li></ul><p>The semi-finals produced two thrilling games, with both clashes won in extra time. Rafael Leao's equaliser cancelled out Phil Foden's opener to send the England vs Portugal game to extra time, and the Three Lions secured their spot in the final in dramatic style, with Jack Grealish scoring two minutes into added time of extra time to make it 2-1.</p><p>In the other semi-final tie, Brazil left it late to book their spot in the World Cup final, beating Argentina 3-2 after extra time. A 94th-minute penalty saw Neymar make it 2-2 to take the game all the way to 120 minutes, and Raphinha scored just three minutes into added time to win the game for Brazil.</p><h4>Final: England 1-0 Brazil</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28679311.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_WC-FINAL.jpg><p>Like most World Cup finals, the clash between England and Brazil was very close, with both sides creating limited chances. Brazil were reduced to 10 men after 65 minutes when substitute Bruno Guimaraes was sent off, and in the 86th minute, Harry Kane scored the goal to win England the 2022 World Cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28692494.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS285507145.jpg><p>Overall, FM23 predicts that England could win just their second World Cup trophy in their history, with Harry Kane's late strike the only goal in a 1-0 win over Brazil in the final. The Three Lions conceded just one goal in the knockout stages, keeping clean sheets against Brazil and France as they won their first World Cup since 1966.</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Two men arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary near Raheem Sterling's home</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Liverpool 'fav</b></a> <a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>ourites' to sign Jude Bellingham and pip Real Madrid to England's new hero</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>France fans in London to have private showing of World Cup clash to avoid huge punch-ups</b></a></p></li><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28675490><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="Bernardo Silva didn't celebrate with team-mates to avoid little known FIFA law" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28675490><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28675625.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_bruno-pitch-cele-grab-main-2.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28675625.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_bruno-pitch-cele-grab-main-2.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28675490>Bernardo Silva didn't celebrate with team-mates to avoid little known FIFA law</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28674477><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="Ronaldo's sister claims star was 'humiliated' by Portugal boss in furious rant" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28674477><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28674375.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-1.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28674477>Ronaldo's sister claims star was 'humiliated' by Portugal boss in furious rant</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cL%2FIpqylmaSasW5%2Bj2tpZq%2Bfp7mlecKup2ajnqSwrLvUrWRrcGZmfnKFlQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
