Between the stress of navigating the pandemic and breaking up with hormonal birth control, I’ve been left with a face full of breakouts. Sounds like a blast, right?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the worst of my blemishes are behind me, uneven skin texture, minor scarring, and hyperpigmentation serve as constant reminders of where they once took up real estate. I was ready to try something new. Enter: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.skinlaundry.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Skin Laundry" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Skin Laundry</a>, the skincare company known for its medical-grade 15-minute laser facials.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Skin Laundry has made a name for itself through noninvasive laser treatments, the company is now rolling out a new non-laser option: the Thermo Fractional Facial. Available in New York, Arizona, and now California, each session costs $300 (or $350 per month for three facials with a subscription). “Skin Laundry’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.skinlaundry.com/thermo-fractional data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thermo Fractional Facial" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Thermo Fractional Facial</a> is a resurfacing treatment,” Mina Chun, Skin Laundry’s regional head nurse, says. “This option is great for clients who are concerned with fine lines, wrinkles, irregular skin texture, acne scars, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, dull skin, and enlarged pores.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong><strong>The Treatment</strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The beauty of the Thermo Fractional Facial is that it’s safe for all skin tones and can be done any time of year. However, anyone getting a treatment should limit sun exposure, and avoid self-tanners and tanning beds at least a week prior.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Hyaluronic Acid Serum</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Shop at skinlaundry.com for Hyaluronic Acid Serum" data-href=https://store.skinlaundry.com/products/hyaluronic-acid-serum data-product-url=https://store.skinlaundry.com/products/hyaluronic-acid-serum data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shop at skinlaundry.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://store.skinlaundry.com/products/hyaluronic-acid-serum data-vars-ga-product-id=12ae0aa2-3096-4fae-9e5a-758f4c52c7c5 data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5b65099b-e52c-4624-a681-7bef839ca100 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=hyaluronic-acid-serum data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Hyaluronic Acid Serum" title="Hyaluronic Acid Serum" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1658439515-TA-WEBSITE_0002_Layer-1_1104x_0002_Layer-1_1104x.png width=1104 height=1288 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Hyaluronic Acid Serum</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: Courtesy</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Each treatment is administered by one of Skin Laundry’s registered nurses. Here’s what goes down: First, the face is cleansed with an alcohol wipe before the Tixel Thermo-Mechanical Action (TMA) device (which kind of resembles a glue gun) is applied to the face. Each time the device’s medical-grade titanium tip is placed on the skin, it creates superficial micro-channels that feel like having a heated stamp punched all over your face. “This resurfacing treatment transfers thermal energy to the upper layer of the skin and creates tiny channels of well-controlled micro-injuries,” Chun says. “These micro-injuries initiate a natural healing response, boosting collagen, and also provide a means for better product penetration. The heat energy causes collagen and elastin to contract, which leads to skin-tightening benefits.” One session takes about 15 minutes. Afterward, a hyaluronic acid serum is applied.<br></p><img alt="thermo fractional facial process jamie wilson" title="thermo fractional facial process jamie wilson" width=3000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jamie-wilson-1658771011.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Before/ Immediately Post-Treatment/ After Four Treatments</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The Recovery</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chun explains that compared to older thermal technologies, this one leads to less downtime. Don’t be surprised if, for the first hour or so after treatment, your face looks quite red and feels like a bad sunburn. For me, that feeling subsided about an hour and a half post-session.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The micro-channels take roughly six hours to close, which is why you’re directed to apply Skin Laundry’s hyaluronic acid serum every hour for six hours as a part of the after-care instructions. After six hours, you can apply a hydrating mask or go straight to adding a gentle emollient moisturizer to soothe your skin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the next day, you might notice some small scabs (yep, scabs) form from the healed micro-channels. Twenty-four hours post-treatment, you should avoid excessive sweating (like a workout), as well as using SPF. For 48 hours, you shouldn’t wear makeup or use any methods of exfoliation. It’s also recommended to steer clear of direct sun exposure for a week (your hat will become your best friend). After one week, your face should be fully healed and you can even get another treatment.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong><strong>The Results</strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had a series of four Thermo Fractional Facials. The biggest improvement was in my skin texture; I don’t think my face has ever felt this smooth, and my mild acne scarring became less visible too. As for my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, it hasn’t fully faded, but I did notice lightening of those areas, especially because I no longer need full-coverage makeup to achieve an even-looking tone. Although I didn’t see too much skin tightening, that also wasn’t a skin concern for me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Four treatments was enough for me to see results, but it may not be for everyone. “The number of treatments needed for each patient depends on the severity of their skin condition and goals,” Chun says. “However, you will be able to notice an improvement in your skin after each treatment.”</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The Verdict</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you’re looking for a quick, noninvasive resurfacing treatment with relatively minimal downtime, the Thermo Fractional Facial is worth it. In a few treatments, you do notice improved texture and enjoy baby-smooth skin. However, when it comes down to completely clearing issues like stubborn hyperpigmentation, that could take quite a few sessions (keep in mind the $300-per-treatment price tag). So you might consider an alternative for that particular concern.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3RnmaabGBrhXN%2FlXBmrKOZo3qtrdSnm6uxXam1pr7MqGSfqpGYwaq7zZqjZp6RmLaiuIyrnK%2Bhlax8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
