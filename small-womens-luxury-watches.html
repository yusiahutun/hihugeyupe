The salesperson very enthusiastically pitched the largest model to me. “Oh, women today are allll about the big watches,” he explained. “Don’t even bother trying on the small.” For context, this particular watch comes in two sizes—small and medium—and with the medium’s case size coming in at 30 millimeters by 25 millimeters. It’s not even considered a “big” timepiece by today’s standards. But nevertheless, I tried on the medium, and my heart sank. This watch felt oversized and bulky on my wrist, and I couldn’t even see the gorgeous chain-link bracelet that sets the Française apart from the other Cartier Tanks. I took a photo of the watch for good measure and slept on it. But the more I thought about it, the more distraught I became. Why shouldn't I give a second thought to the small version?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To be clear, this salesperson should probably get a raise. In a lot of cases, a woman will walk into a watch boutique and be led directly to the tiny, rose gold, diamond-encrusted “ladies” watches. There’s a phrase in the industry to describe ladies watches, by the way: “Pink it and shrink it.” Watch manufacturers somehow got it in their heads that, in order for a watch to appeal to a female-identifying demographic, it has to be tiny, bedazzled, and pink. But one size does not fit all! As <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/suzannewongxx/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Suzanne Wong" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Suzanne Wong</u></a>, cofounder of women’s watch collective <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/watch_femme/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Femme" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Watch Femme</u></a>, says, “What is a woman’s watch? It is a watch owned by a woman.” Elle Macpherson, for example, has been rocking her 40mm Rolex Daytona since the ’80s, and it’s not just glamazon supermodels wearing the big dogs. Women in the watch world are completely fed up with the “pink it and shrink it” mentality, and we’ve gotten to a point where the existence of timepiece gender labels are nearing extinction.<br></p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Small Watches<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Cara Barrett’s earth-shatteringly good “All Watches Should be Unisex” HODINKEE <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/all-watches-should-be-unisex-and-heres-why data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=article class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">article</a>, she throws the gauntlet down, challenging the watch industry to stop dictating what female-identifying people should wear on their wrists. “Call me crazy, but sometimes what I’m looking for is actually the latest steel sport watch that measures at least 36mm,” she writers. This is all wonderful, and to see Barrett’s article shared by literally everyone I know on the Internet made me feel hopeful and excited. And yet … and yet … I prefer small watches.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Trying on that Française watch didn’t make me feel powerful or strong; it made me feel weak and small by association (to my therapist, if you’re reading this … let’s unpack). And it’s not just the Cartier models. It’s the 39mm Omega Speedmaster my friend let me wear for a night; it’s even the 36mm Datejust I tried on during that same Tourneau outing. Being relatively new to the watch world, I almost felt like there was something wrong with me—that I was anti-feminist for wanting a smaller piece. Absurdly, you know what really excites me? A vintage 22mm Rolex I tried on—22mm! That’s a few millimeters larger than a dime.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, how did we get here? Women have been wearing watches for centuries now–years before their male counterparts started opting for wrist watches over pocket watches as a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-24/how-world-war-i-changed-watches-forever data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="result of WWI" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">result of WWI</a>. Women’s watches were essentially jewelry that told time; teensy tiny pieces like Queen Elizabeth’s II’s Jaeger-LeCoultre, which is fitted with the world’s smallest mechanical movement (designed for her to discreetly check the time during Coronation, of course). Then as watches developed – with more complications and value to people in the workforce (historically, men) – we got away from the “watches as jewelry” model. Think: watches designed for aviation, diving, hanging out in caves, and whatever else adventurous men used to do while the women were at home "baking pies." Even as a woman’s role evolved in society, ladies watches remained more petite – typically quartz – versions of the men’s watches.</p><img alt="datejust rolex watch 26mm britt ekland" title="datejust rolex watch 26mm britt ekland" width=1024 height=894 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fc4d0dcc-2115-4fd0-ba22-9104b06485a3-1624988164.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Actress Britt Ekland captured by Slim Aarons, wearing a 26mm Rolex Datejust watch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you look at most vintage watches, you’ll see that they rarely exceed 36mm.

And a lot of men today want their women to go even bigger! In fact, I even engaged in a little comments-section debate on one of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CNFpZzOrIIL/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="my posts" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>my posts</u></a>, in which I was sporting a 26mm Rolex Datejust. Liz Eswein, the creative mind behind <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/newyorkcity/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@newyorkcity class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@newyorkcity</a> on Instagram, tagged menswear designer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/aaronplevine data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Aaron Levine" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Aaron Levine</u></a> in the comments, saying, “See!!! 26mm.” She was using my image to prove a point that small watches are viable options, to which he responded, “Hard disagree.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mr. Levine is not alone here. Miranda Levitt, who owns a showroom for fashion designers in New York, tells me that when she was looking for a 26mm model herself, she was met with a lot of resistance from dealers and “watch guys” dismissing that size as “out of style” or simply something they do not sell. But Zoe Abelson, of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/watchgirloffduty/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Girl Off Duty" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Watch Girl Off Duty</a>, says, “Smaller watches are slowly making a comeback. Collectors are starting to focus more on earlier-generation (vintage and ’90s) references of current models that are made in smaller case sizes.” For Abelson, a man wearing a small watch conveys a sense of self-assurance. “I’m more attracted to men wearing something vintage and smaller (Ryan Gosling in a vintage Rolex Air King 34mm comes to mind).” Regardless of attraction, it appears that some men are simply fatigued by the wave of XL watches, and looking for something more unique and fashion forward.</p><img alt="vintage small watches" title="vintage small watches" width=839 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2b841bee-a749-4f9f-b34f-a81b0739fd21-1624988448.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Princess Diana wearing a tiny Vacheron Constantin; Ryan Gosling in his 34mm Rolex Air King; Queen Elizabeth II wearing her tiny JLC during Coronation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/jjjvlll/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Van Lieshout" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>John Van Lieshout</u></a>, partner at the cocktail bar La Noxe, recently bought a 28mm Omega Constellation for its understated elegance: “You have a beautiful watch with a beautiful movement and you don’t need that machismo thing.” Similarly, Nicholas Santiago, one of the geniuses behind streetwear brand and creative agency <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/pizzaslime/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pizzaslime class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Pizzaslime</u></a> is eyeing the traditionally feminine Cartier Baignoire for his next purchase: “I’m def not scared of a smaller watch… I honestly think the bigger the watch, the douchier it looks.” And metal matters ”there’s truly nothing like a little gold watch,” Watchonista marketing specialist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=0 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.instagram.com/jessicajjo/__;!!Ivohdkk!ye3YPROWeX5O6iwrdCfmrByl-WGiMktiePUuo1bzTRXaCle5YeeGqjW32SAu$ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JJ Owens" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">JJ Owens</a> stated as we were admiring Bella Hadid’s mini Cartier Panthere (aka the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a35851863/cartier-panthere-watch-it-girls/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="It-Girl Watch" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>It-Girl Watch</u></a>). Any bigger and her gold watch might feel a little gaudy – or at a minimum, less versatile (Bella loves to stack). GQ Senior Associate Editor Sam Hine thinks it’s stylish when the watch is low-key, like Bella’s, regardless of gender: “Too many guys want someone across the room to notice they’ve got a Rolex on, so they buy a big one. But a small watch is a watch for yourself – a vintage Panthère is pretty subtle, but real heads will spot it and will probably think you’re really cool because Keith Richards wore one too.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No matter what any of us say, it all comes down to individual preference. “I think the funniest thing about small watches is that enthusiasts who like them frame a love for big watches in morally judgmental terms,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/jackjforster/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack Forster" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Jack Forster</u></a>, editor in chief at HODINKEE, says. “And, of course, those who like big watches do the same thing.” This humbled me a bit; at some point, I definitely thought that I was some kind of martyr for liking small watches. I’ve learned over time, though, that there’s no one right way to do it. The reason why watches are so popular and obsessed over is because they are so personal. “If you really love watches and are around them long enough,” Forster continues, “you (I hope) eventually get to a point where you wear what you like, for your own reasons, and what a watch says about you is irrelevant background noise.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, I love, love, love a small watch, and no matter what gender you identify with, I suggest giving one a chance. Just be sure you DM me a wrist shot.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/99eac445-e232-421a-a4bd-fb4d1472d23d_1616431166.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Brynn Wallner" title="Headshot of Brynn Wallner" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brynn Wallner is a creative consultant and writer based in New York City.

She discovered her love for timepieces in 2019 while working with the Watches Department at Sotheby's. It took working on an editorial series about select GOAT watches to realize a gap in the narrative – where were the women? Thus DIMEPIECE was born, initially as an Instagram account identifying high-end watches on the wrists of pop culture darlings, now complete with a complementary website.
