He is best known as the founder and leader of the Motown vocal group The Miracles, as well as a solo artist and a producer for many other artists. He has been called “the King of Motown” and “America’s greatest living poet” by Bob Dylan. But how much is Smokey Robinson worth, and how did he earn his wealth?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Career and The Miracles</strong></h2><p>Smokey Robinson was born on February 19, 1940, in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a poor neighborhood and developed a passion for music at an early age. He formed his first doo-wop group, The Five Chimes, with his school friends in the mid-1950s.
