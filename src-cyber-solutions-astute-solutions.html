With the rapid change in the field of technological innovations, we continue to add leading technologies to our existing portfolio to stay ahead of the curve and are ready for unique cybersecurity complexities and future threats to ensure our clients remain protected and compliant.</p><p>SRC Cyber Solutions LLP primarily offers four robust Cybersecurity solutions: Comprehensive Email Security, Automated Patching and Endpoint Management, Asset Visibility and Risk Management, and Third-Party Data Flow security services.&nbsp;</p><p>The company’s commitment extends beyond merely <strong>Cyber</strong><strong> </strong>security services, it is more about solving problems. Its automated solutions transcend traditional defense systems, setting a new standard in the Cybersecurity landscape. At SRC Cyber Solutions LLP, trust, innovation, and security together pave the way for a new era of digital defense and resilience. “We are not safeguarding; we are revolutionizing Cybersecurity,” says <strong>Rohit Khandelwal</strong> (<strong>Managing Partner</strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>In an exclusive conversation with The Enterprise World, Rohit shed light upon the journey of the company, the services it provides, as well as its USPs. Here are some insights from our fascinating conversation:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. What inspired you to start SRC Cyber Solutions, and what has been your biggest challenge in leading it to where it is today?</h3><p>The inspiration behind SRC Cyber Solutions was twofold: firstly, my network in Israel exposed untapped potential in technological ventures. Secondly, recognizing the stark differences between outdated legacy systems and cutting-edge next-gen and automated technology ignited the vision for a bridge, emphasizing top-notch offerings. The greatest challenge in steering the company’s growth has been harmonizing innovation with reliability, and navigating the shifting technology landscape while consistently delivering high-quality solutions.</p><p>Initially, coming from a non-IT background presented some obstacles. We were not well-versed in cybersecurity’s technical facets, and the lack of industry connections was a challenge as well. Absence within the cybersecurity space demanded strategic networking for visibility. Adapting, we navigated uncharted territories, learning to bridge gaps between technical expertise, and developed relationships. Embracing the unfamiliar, we transformed challenges into opportunities, paving our path in cybersecurity with patience, determination, perseverance, and resilience.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. What was the point that triggered the growth of the SRC Cyber Solutions?</h3><p>The turning point in our company’s trajectory was the strategic alignment with renowned entities like the Big 4 cyber advisories and dedicated channel partners who shared our vision- offering a quality technology to resolve the Client’s “pain points” at a realistic price. Collaborating with these influential industry leaders amplified our visibility and credibility within the cybersecurity industry. This association not only validated our expertise but also opened doors to expansive networks and opportunities previously inaccessible. Our dedicated channel partners further expanded our market reach which propelled exponential growth.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. What are the products and services that your company specializes in?</h3><p>We are providers of next-generation, highly automated, capable, user-friendly, and cost-effective technologies in the Cybersecurity and infrastructure domain. Our focus remains to look at technologies that address future challenges.</p><p>We offer 4 robust Cybersecurity solutions:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Comprehensive Email Security:&nbsp;</h2><p>Our email security services use next-gen technology, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Human Intelligence (HI), to combat phishing threats thereby drastically reducing the time to detect and remediate suspicious emails to less than a second. From combating malware and ransomware to addressing credential theft and business email compromise (BEC), and complex impersonations, our highly automated, next-gen solution ensures organizations stay ahead of known and unknown cyber threats.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Automated Patching and Endpoint Management:</h2><p>Our endpoint management solution offers unparalleled control and visibility for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems, along with 380+ third-party applications, catering to all scales of operations. What truly distinguishes us, is our script-based adaptability, providing a customized approach to endpoint management. This unique flexibility guarantees uniform patching, and updates to ensure organization compliance and protection from critical vulnerabilities.</p><p>Our Automated Patching streamlines your IT and delivers actionable data insights, lets you automate virtually any IT workflow, and provides better cybersecurity outcomes by minimizing your risk exposure. Our solution’s intuitive interface makes it not just powerful but also incredibly easy to use, ensuring it’s both capable and user-friendly for seamless endpoint management across diverse systems and applications. It also reduces the risk of potential replay or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Asset Visibility and Risk Management:</h2><p>Our hybrid SaaS/on-premise solution is enriched with cutting-edge Asset DNA technology. This innovation guarantees real-time, all-encompassing asset visibility and proactive risk mitigation, ensuring swift protection within decentralized ecosystems. What sets us apart is our independence from traditional reliance on traffic analysis or behavioral assumptions.</p><p>With our solution, one can navigate the complexities of modern IT landscapes confidently to ensure Zero Trust Access to all the Hardware Assets in an environment. Our Asset Visibility & Risk Management Platform unleashes the power of the entire asset security ecosystem with agnostic, actionable visibility that is critical to asset risk management.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Third-party Data flow:</h2><p>And finally, here we analyze and secure data flows from within an enterprise to outside 3rd parties. 99% of enterprises today do not have any real-time catalog to see which homegrown&nbsp;software products running in the cloud and data centers are connecting&nbsp;to which 3rd&nbsp;party&nbsp;services,&nbsp;and why. We combine shift left, and network&nbsp;traffic shaping to create a real-time catalogue of 3rd&nbsp;party&nbsp;integrations,&nbsp;analyze what data elements are being passed, slice traffic to redact,&nbsp;and replace data elements as needed so privacy, compliance guidelines&nbsp;are not violated.</p><p>This is significant from a cloud perspective – who&nbsp;are your cloud apps talking to, what data are they passing over to&nbsp;3rd parties, and how can you prevent accidents from happening in&nbsp;the first place before data leaves your perimeter and ends up in the wrong hands, in the wrong geographical&nbsp;jurisdiction.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. How have the SRC Cyber Solutions graphs changed since the foundation? Can you share a few statistics?
