 Social networks have made it easier to discover articles, videos, or other links that you find interesting."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It ceased operations forever on June 30, 2018. But don't worry, there are still some StumbleUpon alternatives that let you find interesting web pages with the click of a button.</p><p>One of the internet's premier discovery engines, StumbleUpon randomly showed pages liked by others. You could endlessly click the Stumble button till you found something that piqued your interest.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Social networks have made it easier to discover articles, videos, or other links that you find interesting. But if you want a little bit of that randomness back into your life, there are a few choice sites and apps for that too.</p><h2 id=mix-stumbleupon-39-s-official-alternative>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mix</a>: StumbleUpon's Official Alternative</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mix.png><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Medium post</a>, StumbleUpon co-founder Garrett Camp said they were encouraging current users to move to its new platform, Mix. Mix even lets you import all your current StumbleUpon favorites, interests, and tags.</p><p>Browse around, and you'll find that Mix is like an organized version of StumbleUpon. The web's best links are curated in one place and presented in your dashboard, based upon your interests. Click a button and the link is added to your Collection, which you can read later on your mobile. The only thing missing is StumbleUpon's feeling of randomness and serendipity.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Mix has mobile apps for Android and iOS, but the site works perfectly on a mobile browser, so there's hardly anything that an app is going to add to that. So <a href=#>turn the site into an app</a> and use Mix freely.</p><h2 id=discuvver-find-a-useful-website-you-didn-39-t-know-about>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discuvver</a>: Find a Useful Website You Didn't Know About</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stumbleupon-discuvver.png><p>StumbleUpon and others like it have always been about interesting links. Utility was never the focus, it was more about passing some time in an entertaining way. Discuvver focuses on useful websites exclusively, but adds StumbleUpon's randomness to it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Click the <strong>Take me to a useful website</strong> button on the homepage to open a new tab with a random website in it. You can click that button as many times as you want. Discuvver doesn't seem to run out of suggestions, so it will keep you entertained for hours.</p><p>Just remember to keep the Discuvver site open in one tab because there isn't a button on each new page you visit. You'll always have to go back to the main site to get that button. This also means Discuvver is a better experience on desktops than mobiles.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=jumpstick-a-new-stumbleupon-alternative>3. <a href=#>Jumpstick</a>: A New StumbleUpon Alternative</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jumpstick.png><p>Jumpstick works in a similar way to the now-defunct StumbleUpon. You can select themes and topics that interest you, then the site will suggest URLs and other content based on those choices.</p><p>The list of topics is really extensive, just like StumbleUpon's used to be. To highlight the diversity, here are some of the categories that you can subscribe to:</p><ul><li>Camping</li><li>Dogs</li><li>Poetry</li><li>Statistics</li><li>Mediation Products</li><li>Programming</li><li>Accounting</li><li>Cool</li><li>Yoga</li></ul><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can make an account, or you can start browsing immediately by clicking on the Start Jumping button at the top of the page.</p><h2 id=url-roulette-give-a-link-get-a-link>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">URL Roulette</a>: Give a Link, Get a Link</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/urlroutlette.png><p>For a truly random experience, URL Roulette is the place to go. It's one of the <a href=#>best time-wasting sites when you're bored</a>.</p><p>It's a give-and-take experience. Here's how it works. Go to URL Roulette and paste any interesting link you know of. The site will immediately take you to another such link submitted by someone else. By the time you finish with that, you'll be ready for another.</p><p>So again, paste an interesting link and get one more. It's the same randomness of StumbleUpon, but this time, you feel a part of the community.</p><p>If you want a quick list of URLs, subscribe to the newsletter or check out the latest issue. There, you will find the week's top 10 submitted URLs, so it's an easy way to get 10 cool clicks without having to submit something for each one.</p><h2 id=r-interestingasf-the-true-stumbleupon-successor>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">/r/InterestingAsF***</a>: The True StumbleUpon Successor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stumbleupon-iaf.jpg><p>The best successor for StumbleUpon comes from Reddit, with a name that has an unfortunate expletive in it. But don't worry, the content in the IAF Subreddit is heavily moderated, and posts with adult content are clearly marked as NSFW.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The community at IAF shares links of all kinds, whether it's a video, an image or GIF, an article, or a whole website. Sort them by latest or top posts, go for the more controversial ones, or browse in any pattern you want. You won't be disappointed with the collection here, as the moderators do a great job of regulating the quality of posts here.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a true randomizer here, but given how regularly IAF gets updated, you won't need it.</p><h2 id=sharkle-randomness-for-your-eyes-and-ears>6. <a href=#>Sharkle</a>: Randomness for Your Eyes and Ears</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sharkle.png><p>Not everyone has the time or the inclination to spend hours reading content. Sometimes, you just want some simple relief for your eyes or ears. And that's where Sharkle can help.</p><p>When you click on <strong>Show me something awesome</strong>, Sharkle will load a site that is either visually or audibly stimulating. It might be a simple game that looks cool (one game's objective was to keep the ball in the ring, which was immensely satisfying for 30 minutes), an audio loop, or something else entirely.</p><p>Either way, you can be confident that Sharkle won't leave you needing to read words on a page.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=digg-stumbleupon-meets-reddit>7. <a href=#>Digg</a>: StumbleUpon Meets Reddit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/digg.png><p>Yes, Digg does still exist, and surprisingly, it is better than ever. It's not a true StumbleUpon alternative—you still need to click on articles that pique your interest, rather than having the complete randomness that StumbleUpon offered. But, it is a fantastic way to find content on topics that you might not have otherwise thought of.</p><p>Like Reddit, Digg is subdivided into communities. If you make an account, you can subscribe to the ones that interest you the most. Even if you don't make an account, you can explore the impressively diverse homepage and be sure to find something that is worth reading.</p><h2 id=best-stumbleupon-alternatives-for-time-wasting-hellip>Best StumbleUpon Alternatives for Time-Wasting…</h2><p>StumbleUpon's greatest gift was the joy of time-wasting. You kept clicking away at that button and finding things that are weird, wacky, and downright pointless. While it's not the same, these sites offer similar silly pointlessness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fqMG2ucGlnK6on6N6orjTnqmnmaSew6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
