Do you know anything about this?</p>The Dictator: Sure, I'll tell you what I know (a lot, naturally). First, Swiss designer Henri Beguelin began creating handmade leather goods on the Italian island of Elba in the 1970s. As the business grew, he opened shops in Milan and, eventually, around the world. Second, the website, <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.henrycuir.it</span></a>, will tell you what some of the designs look like, but little else. Third, although very popular in Japan, where the brand has quite a few standalone boutiques, all the goods are made in Italy, but it's sold in Hong Kong by Japanese retailer 45 rpm (Leighton Centre, Causeway Bay, tel: 2504 2445). The staff told us the new delivery is due to land soon (if you leave your details with them, they promise to call you when it arrives). With a focus on hand-craftsmanship rather than fashion statements, the brand uses natural cowhide and recycled materials to create limited series and one-of-a-kind pieces. In contrast to the obvious branding, logos and coloured soles used to signify status symbols these days, Henry Cuir is identified simply by its quality and a tiny embroidered stick figure emblem. Buyers should expect to spend about HK$1,495 and up for leather and bead necklaces or keychains; HK$2,495 for wallets; HK$4,395 for women's shoes; and HK$8,895 and up for bags.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdpboN2gJZoqq2xnJp6tLTEZqmupJWo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
