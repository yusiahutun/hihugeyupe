The King of Kowloon, real name Tsang Tsou-choi, was a graffiti artist who used brush and ink to daub Chinese calligraphy on Hong Kong’s streets.
He began his work in 1956 and was initially considered a madman. However, by the 1990s he was recognised as an artist, and by the time of his death in 2007 he was an icon."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He began researching artists, visiting galleries and going to art studios.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The art scene wasn’t that developed, and artists were a lot more accessible. I went to Fo Tan [an artists’ area in Hong Kong’s New Territories]. I learned about Hong Kong art and then Chinese art and collecting things I could connect to,” he says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Art Basel Hong Kong 2024, back at full scale, draws a diverse VIP crowd</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau isn’t a fan of the term “art collector”, preferring “art lover”, and has proved to have a voracious appetite.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he is much more than a man of means collecting pretty shiny things. He has a clear vision and strategy for what he’s doing and can articulate it well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All collectors have urgent stories to tell. For someone like me, born in the 1970s, who has lived in Hong Kong, worked in [mainland] China and seen the economic miracle, used start-up internet but also broadband and VR – there’s a Hong Kong story in me, a China story, and a technology story.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Those are the three themes I collect. I feel they are urgent stories that I want to tell, and I have the experience to connect the dots.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/29/613d65ec-cbd7-4c87-9a77-c35ccbe3ed33_8d16e9e9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Keep in mind that until 20 years ago, Lau’s most significant encounter with art was Damien Hirst’s shark at London’s Saatchi Gallery. So the fact that he has not only built up an impressive art collection – much of it stored in a studio in Wong Chuk Hang – but can neatly explain his approach is impressive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think of myself as someone who is putting together an archive rather than just an art collection,” he says. “When I look at an artwork and an artist, I’ll think of what stories they are trying to tell and how I interpret it through my own personal experience, and how that fits into the broader narrative of what I’m trying to say.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That kind of talk doesn’t come from spending seven years in Shenzhen setting up the insurance business for Tencent, or heading up a US$6 billion blockchain company – the day jobs that have funded Lau’s passion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It comes from spending quality time not just with artists but with the art establishment: the curators, museum directors, arts centre directors and academics who shape the art world.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I don’t like to get boxed into one thing. The minute I get boxed in, I want to move outAlan Lau</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few years into his art collecting, Lau was at the 2009 Venice Biennale when he ran into some of the board members of Para Site, a contemporary Hong Kong arts centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The board was not short of architects, designers and artists, but they needed someone who understood finance and could read a balance sheet. Lau immediately offered to help and has been on the board ever since. He currently serves as chairman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Para Site was just the first. He now also serves as vice-chairman of Hong Kong’s M+ museum, and is co-chair of the Guggenheim’s Asian Art Circle and the Tate’s Asia-Pacific Acquisitions Committee.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Great art films can be shot in Hong Kong’: Chinese artist on M+ movie</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The weight of responsibility that comes with these positions is not lost on him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I joined the Tate acquisition committee, Frances Morris, who was the director at the time, said, ‘Alan, it’s great you’ve joined. What we do here is choose Asian art works to go into the Tate’s global collection. Whatever we buy is going to be good for next 100 years.’ So, no pressure,” Lau jokes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Acutely aware of his role in the selection of art to frame perspectives of history, he says it’s important to negotiate the delicate balance of not just buying the work of well-established deceased artists, but to also lean in and support less-established contemporary artists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a member of various boards, he gets a “behind the scenes” take on the art world and is invited to join research tours and visit artists in their studios. The conversations on these trips have deepened his understanding of art and given him a front-row seat on decisions in the art world that are out of reach of many collectors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/29/89d40cdf-4851-4244-8593-b88c48e9bf6a_01587452.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What’s more, there is a lot of fun to be had.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve made so many new friends. We share a common language and passion, it’s a real community. And it’s global – you hear stories from different parts of the world. I really cherish that,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau’s personal collection is diverse and includes a vinyl disc made of ice by Japanese artist Lyota Yagi that melts and changes in sound as it’s being played, to highlight the passing of time; and some of Ai Weiwei’s Neolithic vases, originally dating back to as long ago as 5,000BC, which the artist dripped in industrial paint to symbolise destruction and rebirth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Daphne King Yao, who runs Alisan Fine Arts in Hong Kong, recently commented that young Chinese collectors aren’t as drawn to Chinese paintings and Chinese contemporary art, preferring Western art.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Light art installation in Hong Kong’s East Kowloon slammed for ‘funeral vibe’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She put this down in large part to the big Western galleries that woo collectors and throw parties for them. Lau says he has noticed this and puts it down to “cultural confidence”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think there is a cohort of collectors who feel they need Western art that is recognised. I guess the younger generation is exposed to a lot more Western art, but it’s also about cultural concerns – Western and foreign is ‘better’. It is not necessarily so, it’s a perception. That’s what I mean by cultural confidence,” says Lau, who estimates about a third of his collection is made up of works by Chinese artists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau says there is a trend of Japanese collectors to not collect Japanese art. If that’s the case, who is collecting Japanese art? Everyone else, he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you are still at the stage where there isn’t enough cultural confidence, and you feel you need to carry that foreign bag or foreign phone, and you don’t believe that something done locally is as good, maybe it’s a phase or maybe it’s many years, but hopefully we don’t end up being like Japan,” he says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Some days I spend 10 hours carving’: Hong Kong’s printmakers spotlighted</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Young people who are just getting into collecting naturally go to what is free, and in Hong Kong that used to be the auction houses and Western galleries, Lau says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They see the top sellers and that’s a very narrow set of art. But now we have Tai Kwun and M+ and they are defining the narrative and hopefully opening up new pockets of interest for people,” he explains, believing that the outlook for the art scene in Hong Kong is far from bleak.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for Lau, he intends to keep his eyes wide open and follow his many and varied interests that include everything from art that can be framed and hung on a wall to unwieldy sculptures, performance art and NFTs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t like to get boxed into one thing,” he says. “The minute I get boxed in, I want to move out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR%2BlHBpaXFfqa61sYymZKCtl5yyr7TEoqRmoJ%2BjtG63zqeeZpufobmmr9OoqWaZnpl6rLHYZpirrF2lrrW%2BzqdkoqampLm3scNmq6GdnWKurbiMppyerF2jsrOw2GaerrFdlrmiuoylmK4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
