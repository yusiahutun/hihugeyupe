The TikTok star, who had someone film him ruining the music icon’s record, probably wasn’t expecting one of her loyal fans coming to the rescue."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But the singer knows how to ‘shake it off’ so any negative commentary usually goes over her head. But one Taylor Swift ‘hater’ who filmed himself destroying one of her vinyls saw his act of revenge backfire when he was trolled on TikTok.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> star, who had someone film him ruining the <a href=#>music</a> icon’s record, probably wasn’t expecting one of her loyal fans coming to the rescue. But she did. Not only that, but she pointed out some key facts that appear to transform the hater into a Swiftie himself. Confused? You bet. We think he’s not a Tay Tay hater at all, and really, he’s kept <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>‘s vinyl record safe because the TikTok was all for show.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-i-don-t-like-you>‘Taylor Swift, I don’t like you’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1170383972-1.jpg><p>The video in question, which was liked almost 94,000 times, starts with the ‘hater’ declaring he doesn’t like the singer.</p><p>He says: “Tomorrow is the AFC Championship, my [Baltimore] Ravens take on the Kansas City Chiefs and Taylor Swift.</p><p>“Taylor Swift, I don’t like you.” He believed the Chiefs would be beaten by the Ravens, but his predictions were actually wrong. Because they won the game, and now the Chiefs are set to play the 49ers at the Super Bowl. Woops.</p><p>He continues: “I just left Target with your album, this is what I think about your music.”</p><p>With a sports jersey on, he holds up Taylor Swift’s 1989 vinyl. Then he appears to take out the record, momentarily looking deep into the camera before throwing it onto the ground.</p><p>The vinyl smashes into hundreds of pieces, scattered all over the floor. The camera pans to the floor to see how it’s definitely miles beyond repair, as the guy stares down the lens again, with absolutely no emotion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-hater-smashes-her-vinyl-in-tiktok>Taylor Swift ‘hater’ smashes her vinyl in TikTok</h2><p>Noticing something was up, a Swiftie stitches the clip with her own take.</p><p>She says: “Oh, that’s crazy. Because Taylor Swift never came out with a black version of the 1989 vinyl. So, where’s your copy at, pookie? What’s your favorite track? Bad Blood? You play it all the time?”</p><p>The fan is pointing out how the music star, who re-released 1989 (Taylor’s Version) in vinyl form, came in blue. However, there were also other colors, such as a yellow-gold, green, and pink. But no black in sight.</p><p>Now, an LP was released for 1989, with a black vinyl, with the cover featuring the music star’s famous Polaroid photo. But, the guy in the TikTok is clearly holding her recently released vinyl, which came out in 2023. So the two don’t add up. He also declared he just ‘bought’ the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s album in Target. So definitely new.</p><p>Even if he somehow had the 2020 version (black), why would he place it in the new vinyl cover (blue), and proceed to smash it? It also would only just show that he bought not one, but two vinyls. Which is odd for a non-fan, wouldn’t you say?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-think-he-smashed-up-a-pink-floyd-record-instead>Fans think he smashed up a Pink Floyd record instead</h2><p>TikTokers are trying to Sherlock Holmes the answer. They reckon he pulls out Pink Floyd The Wall record to smash up, but it’s too quick to really tell.</p><p>Others claim another video shows that he replaces it, trying to prank the Swiftie kingdom, but it’s hard to track down. It’s not on his own profile, though.</p><p>One follower wrote: “The fact that he had to spend his money on the actual vinyl for that case, lmao”</p><p>A second said: “He thought he could trick the Swifties”.</p><p>Then a third testified: “Even if it was the right vinyl, he probably still paid for it before destroying it”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WAcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02afmqyVp3q4tM5mqZ6bn6extHnHoqSsnZyberS5wKyfoqaXYsKxedWipbKkXZ7AbrnOnKKenF2ku27AyKSrqKNf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
