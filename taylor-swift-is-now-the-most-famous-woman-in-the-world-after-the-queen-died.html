Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid has come out to talk about the singer once again, after knowing her for several years.

He even met <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> before she began dating the 34-year-old, so that must have been awkward for him. Although <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> is his player, he hasn’t stopped gushing over the musician for her being so down to Earth. He spoke about how the <a href=#>music</a> star presented homemade pop tarts to the players at a game, which is so non-billionaire of her. Not only that, but he’s pretty certain Taylor Swift’s as famous as <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>. That’s a pretty big statement Andy.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1474302747-1024x681.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singer-is-different-behind-the-scenes>Singer is different behind the scenes</h2><p>During an interview with Mike Florio and Chris Simms at the NFL Scouting Combine, he said the <a href=#>celebrity</a> cooked something sweet for some of the team.</p><p>The 65-year-old said: “Kind of behind-the-scenes … she likes to cook, so she made the offensive linemen these homemade pop-tarts.</p><p>“So it was over. She knew right where to go.”</p><p>But it seems Tay-Tay miscalculated because she didn’t even end up handing one out to Andy.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>He laughed: “She didn’t give me one, and the offensive linemen definitely didn’t give me one.”</p><p>Although he doesn’t mind joking about the <a href=#>Grammy</a>-award-winning star, he also praises her. Like a lot.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> she is “so grounded for who she is”.</p><p>Reid has also seemed to bat away any negativity surrounding <a href=#>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship</a>. The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> received a lot of heat in the lead up to the Super Bowl. Fans were either obsessed over whether they <a href=#>would get engaged</a>, or trolls claimed she was ruining the game. But famous stars came out to defend her, saying <a href=#>Taylor was the best thing to have happened to the NFL</a>.</p><p>Then the Chiefs won the Super Bowl – and we got to see <a href=#>Taylor and Travis’ celebratory kiss</a> on the field – so that should end that argument.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-is-the-most-famous-woman-in-the-world-after-the-queen-died>Taylor Swift is the ‘most famous woman in the world’ after the queen died</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1917155445-1024x683.jpg><p>Reid has known her family for some time, but he thinks her stardom is beyond global.</p><p>He added: “I knew&nbsp;her <a href=#>dad and her mom</a>&nbsp;— good, solid people. I met her when she was young.</p><p>“I mentioned somewhere that since the queen passed away, she might be the most famous woman in the world. But she handles it.”</p><p>He went on: “I think it’s a great escape for her. She sincerely enjoys the games.”</p><p>Fans know <a href=#>All Too Well Travis Kelce has been the doting boyfriend</a> since they went public. Taylor was seen at Arrowhead Stadium back in September, which almost broke the internet. Although some people thought it was one of their first dates, the singer herself came out to confirm they were already a couple when she headed into that VIP box.</p><p>Travis Kelce himself also explained when he went <a href=#>‘official’ with the singer</a>, so it was all settled before the mania began.</p><p>Not only had she attended 13 out of 19 games to support her beau, but Travis flew down to Argentina last year to do the same. Recently, he even <a href=#>jet-setted 9000 miles</a> to spend a couple of days with her when she was down in Sydney.</p><p>Although, when they went out for a <a href=#>date at Sydney Zoo</a>, some signals were picked up by a body language expert that seemed to show cracks beneath the surface.</p><p>We think they can handle it.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eFcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02agrGWepMRuwMeeZKano6l6p63MqKysZaekuqK6jKKlZqyYmnq4u9Glm2aZlqmys3nToZxmqaWasq95w6KcnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
