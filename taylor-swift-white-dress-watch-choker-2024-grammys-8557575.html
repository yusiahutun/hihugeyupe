The 52-time-nominated artist (who is up for six awards tonight) arrived at the prestigious awards ceremony wearing an unexpected white gown, which may seem like a departure from her recent Reputation-coded looks. However, the look perfectly matches the album's cover.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift wore a white corseted Schiaparelli with the highest leg slit and ruched fabric at her waist that flowed into a floor-grazing train, which she styled with black leather opera gloves, matching peep-toe heels. If the black-and-white color palette wasn't enough of an Easter egg, the pop star dropped another nod to her music with her layered silver-and-black necklaces, one of which was a clock choker set at 12:00 (aka midnight).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The icon wore her blonde hair in a deep side part with a waves and reverse braid draped over her shoulder. In terms of glam, she rocked a cat eye (another Reputation hint) and her signature red lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer is known for dropping Easter eggs in her OOTDs that tease upcoming releases. Fans think her next re-record will be Reputation (Taylor's Version), thanks to her most recent aesthetic (she wore a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bedazzled green dress to the Golden Globes</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>snake-print boots</a> for a girls' night out). At last year's Grammys, the singer wore a Midnights-coded deep blue cropped turtleneck and matching skirt set, which she styled with massive diamond-and-sapphire chandelier earrings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she's not standing on a red carpet, Swift is wearing the color to cheer on her boyfriend Travis Kelce. Last Sunday, Swift wore a crimson sweater to the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Baltimore Ravens. After the Chiefs clinched a coveted spot in the Super Bowl game next week, Swift rushed down to the field to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrate with the tight end</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadly, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kelce will not be joining Swift</a> tonight for the Grammys festivities. Although he would like to be there to support her, he's busy prepping for the big game.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wish I could go support Taylor at the Grammys, and watch her win every single award that she’s nominated for,”&nbsp;he said on an episode of The Pat McAfee Show, per the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hollywood Reporter</a>. “I got practice Saturday, but Sunday is a travel day, unfortunately I have to get ready for this big ole Super Bowl that we got in a week.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Swift hasn't confirmed that she'll be in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>attendance at the 2024 Super Bowl</a> on Feb. 12, Swifties have calculated that Tay will have time to get from her show in Japan to the big game in Vegas — with plenty of time to spare (the math is mathing).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift is nominated in six categories tonight, including Album of the Year, Song of the Year ("Anti-Hero"), Record of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance ("Anti-Hero"), Best Vocal Pop Album, and Best Pop Duo/Performance ("Karma" ft. Ice Spice).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZLCgmamybrDRnqqsZaeWwaS0jJyfqKOVp3pzfJFtZKCqkaK6ur%2BMcWxub2Vsgg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
