A rebound, with John F. Kennedy Jr. Can you imagine? John, for his part, wasn’t the most serious dater at the time — his revolving door of A-listers had included <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rumored flings with Madonna</a> and Cindy Crawford, and he had an on-and-off again relationship with actress Daryl Hannah.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> Celebrity biographer Christopher Andersen <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a> in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow">The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved</a>, that Parker once surprised Kennedy in an NSFW fashion when he returned home from a trip to L.A. He touched down at JFK (naturally) and heard someone call his name outside the terminal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The door of a limousine opened, and out popped Sarah Jessica Parker. Taking her cue from swimwear model Ashley Richardson, Parker wore a mink, high heels, and — as a titillating flash of her coat revealed to John — nothing else,” Andersen wrote. We can think of nothing more glamorous (though we’ll swap “mink” for “faux fur” if it’s all the same to you). Is it true? We hope so — it feels like an oddly specific story to concoct if not.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> In 1992, Parker referred to her time with John and Jackie’s youngest as “the Kennedy fiasco.” They dated for about six months and the soon-to-be Sex and the City star found her suitor “nice,” but was overwhelmed by the notoriety that the relationship brought with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We would go places where there wasn't a soul around, and the next day I'd see pictures of us there in the tabloids," she told the New York Times. “I have been a semi-public person since [starring in Annie on Broadway as a child], but I never had any idea what real fame was until I met John. He's a nice man, but for God's sake, I feel like I should apologize for dating him. It has become the defining factor in the person I am. It's pathetic. When I die, they are going to say, 'Oh, yeah, Sarah once dated John Kennedy.'" This was pre-Carrie Bradshaw, of course.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Time Life Pictures/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Andersen’s biography, the split also had something to do with Kennedy’s good looks. “What you have is wrong," she reportedly joked with him. "It's not right. It's unfair, as a woman, to have to stand next to you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parker has remained close-lipped about their relationship in the decades since Kennedy’s death. During a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2016 episode of Watch What Happens Live</a>, pal Andy Cohen quizzed her on kissing the late political heir. “It was pleasant,” she said shyly. “He had exquisite hair,” she went on, “It was like a paintbrush, do you know what I mean?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The SATC alum revealed her reservations about not sharing more details, explaining, “I feel like we’ve covered this territory, like if he were alive I’d feel more comfortable, if he were accomplishing all the things that I’m certain he was going to accomplish, and living a really joyful and adventurous life then I would probably feel more comfortable answering more questions about him.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she didn’t speak about it on the record at the time, she was reportedly “devastated” by his 1999 accident.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>Parker began dating fellow actor Matthew Broderick soon after splitting from Kennedy. They share three children (James, 16, and 9-year-old twins Marion and Tabitha) and are celebrating their 22nd anniversary this coming weekend.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gilbert Carrasquillo/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">SJP came into her own with HBO’s Sex and the City in 1998 and is currently starring in the network’s marital drama, Divorce.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1995 Kennedy launched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>George Magazine</a>, a fashion-meets-politics monthly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year later JFK Jr. wed Calvin Klein publicist Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy in a private ceremony off the coast of Georgia.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Justin Ide/Boston Herald/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the summer of 1999, Kennedy, who’d recently earned his pilot’s license, flew himself, Carolyn, and Carolyn’s sister Lauren Bessette to Martha’s Vineyard for the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy — sadly, the trio never made it to their destination. Kennedy’s plane went missing, and five days after takeoff all three bodies were pulled from the Atlantic. He was 38 years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite his untimely death, Kennedy’s legacy lives on. In 2000, the City University of New York and Reaching Up, a non-profit founded by the lawyer, established the JFK Jr. Institute for Worker Education, which is currently a branch of CUNY’s School of Professional Studies. Three years later Harvard followed suit, renaming the Kennedy School of Government the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum of Public Affairs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8Fuv8CrmKFlmprAtLXCmmSpmaKgsrN5yaifp2WWYrimus2em7Jlmqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
