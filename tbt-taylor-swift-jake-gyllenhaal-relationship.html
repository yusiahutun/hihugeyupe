In December 2010, Paltrow reluctantly&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told&nbsp;USA Today</a>&nbsp;that she played matchmaker after a report surfaced indicating that Swift, just 20 years old at the time, and a 29-year-old Gyllenhaal, met at a dinner party at the London home Paltrow shared with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>then-husband Chris Martin</a>.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've just known Jake for a long time, and he's a great guy," she said, "and Chris has a friendship with Taylor."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "It's so weird. I wonder how people find out these things. It was a while ago, so I don't know why it would come out today."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Admitting she was "scared to say," the only timeline Paltrow gave for the dinner party was "a while ago." However, it was clear by October of that year that something was brewing between Swift and Gyllenhaal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-october-2010-taylor-swift-and-jake-gyllenhaal-are-first-spotted-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>October 2010: Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal are first spotted together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cultural icon and her beau were first seen together backstage at a taping of Saturday Night Live in October 2010. A source told People they had shown up to the SNL taping together, and that "they walked around together backstage, but they were careful not to be seen too close. It was hard to tell if they were together, but everyone was shocked that she brought him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The&nbsp;folklore&nbsp;singer-songwriter and&nbsp;Prisoners&nbsp;actor were first seen together backstage at a taping of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;in October 2010.

Given that the relationship lasted as long as the fall season, the Gyllen-Swift fall agenda was in full force, with appropriately-themed maple latte coffee dates on deck,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>according to&nbsp;People</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>. Throw in Swift's reference to "autumn leaves falling" in a song purportedly written about Gyllenhaal (more on that later).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, when we think of fall, we think of&nbsp;them. It may have been a brief romance, but for a fleeting moment, Swift and Gyllenhaal encapsulated the cuffing season aesthetic, and for that, we loved them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-december-2010-taylor-swift-and-jake-gyllenhaal-break-up></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>December 2010: Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal break up</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By 2011, the autumnal coffee dates and strolls were officially done after the pair reportedly spent the holiday apart. The Grammy Award-winning musician rang in the new year solo in Nashville, while the&nbsp;Ambulance&nbsp;star was in New York City, where he attended a closing party for Broadway's&nbsp;Fela!&nbsp;on January 2. A source&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>confirmed the breakup to&nbsp;People</a>&nbsp;in early January with an aptly succinct quote, telling the outlet, "They're over. It ended last month."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the source didn't give a reason for the split, the relationship (and, presumably, the breakup) appeared to provide fodder for one of Swift's most popular hits. It's now widely accepted that "All Too Well" from Swift's 2012&nbsp;Red&nbsp;album was penned about her relationship with Gyllenhaal, with all of its references to the subject having once been "a little kid with glasses" and a scarf left at his sister's house (hi,&nbsp;Maggie Gyllenhaal).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rumor that the song is about the actor was so widespread that Maggie was forced to publicly answer for the scarf's whereabouts in an interview on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen&nbsp;in 2017.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am in the dark about this scarf. It's totally possible [it's at my house]," she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the&nbsp;WWHL&nbsp;host</a>. "I don't know. I have been asked this before, and I am like, 'What are you talking about?'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The&nbsp;Donnie Darko&nbsp;star, meanwhile, has never been able to shake the association with the song. Swifties flooded his Instagram with red scarf emojis after he shared a photo of himself as, you guessed it, "a little kid with glasses." Not that he'll talk about it, of course.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, when asked if he thought dating Swift was "playing with fire" for someone so intensely private, the&nbsp;Brokeback Mountain&nbsp;actor&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;The Guardian</a>, "I think when you're in a relationship, you are constantly scrutinized, your friends are scrutinized ..."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After trailing off, he added, "I would love to not talk about my personal life."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fair enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9OasKWnomLAuLXFrWatmqRiwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecmaop5ll665rbHNoZiapF2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
