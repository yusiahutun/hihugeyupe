A US start-up firm has created a lightweight, breathable and waterproof alternative that can be worn in the sea, bath or pool. 
Cast21's wide mesh sleeve is slipped onto a patient's wrist and then filled with liquid resins, which hardens into shape within minutes. 
Patients with traditional plaster casts are unable to clean underneath."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Cast21 can be worn in the bath, sea and pool.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Breathable:</span> A plaster cast can make the skin feel very itchy, but it's not possible to clean underneath it. Sometimes people poke things underneath to scratch. This could cause a nasty sore and lead to infection. The Cast21 is like a cage over the arm so the skin can breathe.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Moulded to each patient: </span>Casts can be uncomfortable and it is advised to see a doctor if it becomes loose, too tight - causing swelling or tingly - or cracked. The Cast21 is moulded to each patient using liquid resins with the aim of creating a perfect fit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Quick to fit:</span> Plaster and fiberglass casts can take up to 20 minutes to apply. Then, the patient has to keep the injured limb elevated for a few days to reduce the swelling and any heat in the limb. The Cast21 is less time consuming and less messy. It's not clear if the limb would still need elevation afterwards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>East to remove: </span>When the bone is healed, a plaster cast will be removed with a special saw. The cast saw has a flat, rounded metal blade that vibrates. It can cut through the cast without injuring the skin underneath, but it can be scary for patients. Cast21 needs one snip of tabs at the top which open up the sleeve.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/health/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Hogg said:&nbsp;'The majority of fractures happen in children, adolescents and the elderly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Those saws are very loud and all this debris flies off and it's very messy, it can be extremely frightening.
