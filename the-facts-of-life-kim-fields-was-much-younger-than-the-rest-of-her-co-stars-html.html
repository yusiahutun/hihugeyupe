Series have different ways of dealing with these obstacles. Shameless, for instance, brought in several different actors to portray the young Liam over the years before finally settling on a single actor to portray the character once he’d gotten a bit older."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Drummonds’ housekeeper, Mrs. Garret, was shown being offered a job as a housemother at a private boarding school. That concept would become the premise of&nbsp;The Facts of Life in which Mrs. Garret — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Charlotte Rae</a> — guides a group of girls through their adolescence.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_50>The four primary characters on the series were Blair, Tootie, Natalie, and Jo. The show followed the ups and downs of the young girls’ lives and ran for an astounding nine seasons, giving fans plenty of time to get to know the children as they grew into young women.</p><p id=par-7_38>To keep the girls around after their graduation day came and went, the show had them helping out Mrs. Garret with her business before the shop burned down. This gave the girls the opportunity to rebuild as partners.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-kim-fields-played-dorothy-tootie-ramsey>Kim Fields played Dorothy ‘Tootie’ Ramsey&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kim-fields.jpg><p id=par-8_66>The Facts of Life was a breakthrough role for young actor Kim Fields. She portrayed Dorothy “Tootie” Ramsey on the show, and this was definitely the part that got her name recognition and a platform for ongoing fame. Previous roles on the TV series&nbsp;Baby . . . I’m Back!&nbsp;and&nbsp;Good Times had provided Fields acting experience, but&nbsp;The Facts of Life let her showcase her lead role potential.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_27>After&nbsp;The Facts of Life concluded in 1988, Fields bounced around through TV movies and some guest spots before landing the part of Regine Hunter on&nbsp;Living Single.</p><p id=par-10_52>Fields played that part until 1998. After that, Fields continued to take on small roles, but her fame seemed to fizzle out, making her an ideal choice as a guest on Lisa Kudrow’s&nbsp;The Comeback&nbsp;in 2005. Since then, Fields has made a name for herself as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a feuding housewife</a> on&nbsp;Real Housewives of Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-kim-fields-was-much-younger-than-her-facts-of-life-co-stars>Kim Fields was much younger than her ‘Facts of Life’ co-stars</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_49>The girls in&nbsp;The Facts of Life were all supposed to be teens living in a boarding school, but Kim Fields was actually much younger than her co-stars. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental Floss</a> reports, Fields — who was born in May 1969 — was only 10 years old when the show premiered.</p><p id=par-12_36>By contrast, Mindy Cohn (who played Natalie) was 13 and Lisa Whelchel (who played Blair) was 16. Nancy McKeon joined the set in Season 2 and portrayed Jo. She was the same age as Mindy Cohn.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_45>The series didn’t really make mention of the age gap between the girls, but they did use some clever tricks to disguise the fact that Tootie was significantly shorter than her older co-stars. The character was frequently on roller skates to help hide her height.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMn5icrKNivKd5y6KdnmWbnrpussieo52rXayutHnMrpqhZamkwq%2BzxKtkraCRo3q1tMRmqZ6rpGK8p3nHnqlmm59iwLWt0axloaydoXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
