Her trademark basket bag, laden with her belongings, topped from the overhead locker, spilling, and leaving Jane scrabbling around for its contents.</p><p id=eXFS6q7cLsfW data-wc=25>She expressed her frustration at being unable to find a chic, spacious accessory, especially one which could cater to her needs as a young mother.</p><p id=eTbokS2Z0gCr data-wc=28>Jean-Louis offered his services, and over the course of the flight, Jane sketched out her ideal design, based on an existing Hermès model, on an Air France sickbag.&nbsp;</p><p id=e79DoAiePUSQ data-wc=10><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;The 17 best designer beach bags for summer 2023</a></strong></p><p id=e6LGPHX-3_mK data-wc=10><strong>READ:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;The 8 best crochet bags to shop right now</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d952e206e7f2-gettyimages-51037000.jpg><p id=eP4MCtr7JCeD data-wc=42>The following year, the bag entered the accessory sphere, and since its initial release it has evolved into a hallmark of luxury.
