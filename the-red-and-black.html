The drink was on the menu at Back Forty on Avenue B, an early locavore restaurant that abruptly, and with absolutely no notice, closed and never came back a couple years ago. Like all breakups you didn’t see coming, I’m still a little raw about it. Was it something we did? Something we could have done? But I’m sure they’re not somewhere pouting over us.</p><p><a href=# title="for simple syrup"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4243/34732644732_bb392f40f7_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="for simple syrup" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="black pepper simple syrup"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4269/34732644542_e94149b18f_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="black pepper simple syrup" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="lime juice"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4246/34732644412_663ca0893e_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="lime juice" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="sugar salt pepper rim"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4228/34732644372_f6b1005418_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="sugar salt pepper rim" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="perfect strawberries i miss all year"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4203/34732644252_0961de222f_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="perfect strawberries i miss all year" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title=muddled><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4200/34732644222_a561b89f15_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt=muddled data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I was so obsessed with this drink and the fleeting window of it each spring that I attempted to reverse engineer it in my <a href=#>first cookbook</a>, but I think I did just an okay job. Little did I know the restaurant’s owner, <a href=#>Peter Hoffman</a> had shared his bar manager’s recipe with <a href=#>Food & Wine</a> (in fact, one of you told me, thank you) and we made it this week and, look, nothing is as good as having someone else make you your favorite drink (and then wash all the dishes involved and also can we have some rosemary and sea salt fries to go with that?) but if there could ever be a downside, it’s that those freshly muddled strawberries in the bottom of the glass of ice are the most delicious part and though I’ve tried and tried anyway, there’s no graceful way to get them out (it requires a fork) at a bar. At home, there’s nobody to judge you. I think we know exactly what needs to be done.</p><p><a href=# title="red and black (cocktail)"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4196/34732644062_91e3633c82_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="red and black (cocktail)" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>The Red and Black (Cocktail)</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>2 generous drinks</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong><a href=#>Peter Hoffman and Michael Cecconi via Food & Wine</a></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul><br>I whittled this recipe down from the version they shared with Food & Wine because I needed only 2 drinks, not 10. Or at least not today, heh. As will happen when reducing from quarts and cups, the amounts didn’t totally work but fortunately, I’ve had this enough times that I could adjust things to get it right.<p>Key here is that sparkly black pepper simple syrup, so please don’t skip it. Make more, even, you won’t regret it because it keeps for ages in the fridge. I made it twice; the first time I used 2 solid tablespoons of coarsely ground black pepper and it was so spicy, even smelling it could make you cry. (I was using peppercorns a friend had brought me from Cambodia, lucky me, which might have had more kick.) The second time, I used whole peppercorns and the kick was a bit too mild. Thus, I’ve written it below for something in-between.</p><br><ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup water</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 tablespoon (7 grams) coarsely ground black pepper (see Note up top)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>4 ounces ripe strawberries, hulled and halved</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>5 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>5 ounces (10 tablespoons) blanco tequila</li><h5>To finish</h5><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 lime wedge</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Ice</li></ul><br><strong>Make simple syrup:</strong> Combine sugar, water, and 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer until sugar fully dissolves, stirring; this takes about 1 minute. Cool completely. You can hasten this along by pouring it into a glass you’ve set inside a shallower bowl of ice water; with this method, it takes all of 10 to 15 minutes. Strain syrup and discard black pepper.<p><strong>Make drinks:</strong> Muddle strawberries a medium-sized jar. Add lime juice, 1/2 cup of cooled syrup (if you’re nervous about sweetness, you can hold a little more back), and tequila and stir to combine. You can chill this mixture in the fridge until needed, up until 2 days.</p><p><strong>To finish:</strong> Swipe rims of 2 rocks or equivalent 11 or 12-ounce glasses with lime. Combine 1 tablespoon sugar, 3/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper, and salt in a shallow plate and dip rims in it to coat them. Carefully fill glasses with ice. Divide strawberry-tequila mixture between glasses, including the muddled strawberries. Drink slowly and have no shame about using a spoon to get all of the strawberries from the glass to your mouth.</p><br><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-32209 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-32209 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
