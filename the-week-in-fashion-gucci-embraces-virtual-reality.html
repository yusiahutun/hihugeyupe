House of Holographic GucciWhen the Apple Vision Pro was released this winter, we knew fashion brands were going to embrace the buzzy, highly visual new technology. Now, Gucci is getting in on the action. A few weeks after the premiere of the documentary Who Is Sabato De Sarno? A Gucci Story, the brand is celebrating the film’s release by offering a new immersive experience on the Vision Pro."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A Gucci Story, the brand is celebrating the film’s release by offering a new immersive experience on the Vision Pro.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As users enter the Gucci app on Apple’s virtual reality goggles, they can watch the documentary, plus about 20 minutes of immersive bonus content. This includes 3-D products and other special features, from being transported to Milan to getting to interact with a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnSWMetG-B4" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gucci Jackie Notte" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gucci Jackie Notte</a>. (If only you could come out of it with a real one!)</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Prada Goes to the Movies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In honor of the latest iteration of Prada’s timeless Galleria bag, ambassador Scarlett Johansson appeared in a new campaign shot by The Zone of Interest director Jonathan Glazer, which exemplifies the cinematic power of Prada accessories.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The release from the Italian fashion house draws a direct line between the bag and the work of a constantly evolving actor like the Black Widow star: “As with Johansson, its persona can transform; as with acting, it is a symbol of excellence in craft. Here, the Prada Galleria is showcased, in motion, as a fundamental facet of a woman’s reality.”</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Loewe Plays the Name Game</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Loewe has made a notable effort to get people to pronounce its name correctly. (In case you’re still not sure, it’s: lou-WEH-vay.) In the brand’s very fun new campaign, two comedy stars—Dan Levy and Aubrey Plaza—wring humor out of the many ways people get tripped up by the unexpected spelling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Written by Levy and directed by Ally Pankiw (with creative direction from the label’s creative designer, Jonathan Anderson), the short film Decades of Confusion sees Plaza playing several decades’ worth of spelling bee contestants who all have one thing in common: They simply cannot spell Loewe. Levy plays a series of disgruntled judges, perfectly matching Plaza’s absurd characters in the playful clip, which highlights various pieces from the Spanish label’s archive.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Pucci Pulls Legends</h2><img alt="a person in a dress and a person in a dress" title="Pucci S/S '24 Show" width=1320 height=1980 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pucci-po-s24-041-66107609f0fad.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of EMILIO PUCCI</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">LAUNCHMETRICS SPOTLIGHT</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Attendees gathered Thursday to watch Pucci’s Spring/Summer ’24 “Very Vivara” show at the Palazzo Altemps in Rome, where they were treated to a couple of unexpected guest appearances.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For starters, supermodel Christy Turlington strutted out in the first look—a jet-black caftanlike gown with wavy strokes of color along the collar that looked like Pop art. But perhaps the bigger surprise was the show’s closer: legendary Italian actor and model Isabella Rossellini.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This pick was no coincidence. Back in the ’90s, Rossellini was photographed in the Vivara print that inspired this latest collection. And when she walked out last week, she was wearing an eye-popping Vivara gown, with a print composed of purple, blue, and teal hues. Artistic director Camille Miceli sure found the perfect closer.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Cou Cou for Cotton Jersey</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brooklyn boutique Salter House has earned a devoted following, thanks to owner Sandeep Salter’s edit of rustic housewares and sheer, dreamy nightgowns. Now, the shop is also the exclusive brick-and-mortar retailer of Cou Cou intimates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just this past week, Cou Cou and Salter House hosted an event to celebrate the new collection, which included complimentary embroidery, exclusive pieces in the brand’s English Rose print, and on-site refreshments. Cou Cou is known for sweet pointelle underthings, but the brand just launched cotton jersey as well.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
