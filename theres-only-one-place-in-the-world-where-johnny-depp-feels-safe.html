The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star revealed this in a recent interview where he spoke on what he’s passionate about. His career took a turn when allegations arose from his ex-wife over abuse. The pair fought in a highly-covered civil trial in the courts last year. Ever since a jury ruled in his favor – Heard was found liable for defamation in three separate statements, and Depp was found also liable through a statement his attorney made – he has kept a somewhat low profile.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-johnny-depp-feels-safe-when-nobody-s-looking-at-him>Johnny Depp feels safe when “nobody’s looking at him”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-488255662-1024x815.jpg><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> explained to South China Morning Post that there’s one place in the world where he can truly be himself.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “Where I feel the most myself in this world, and where I go to feel absolutely normal, I suppose, is my place in the Bahamas, because it’s an island and nobody’s looking at me.</p><p>“You’ve got to have some sanctuary, a safe place where you can escape the scrutiny and the interest of others, a place where you can just sit on a beach, read, paint, meditate or whatever, that’s freedom to me.</p><p>“That’s the only real freedom.”</p><p>Depp also spoke of longing to be able to go out, without being recognized. Adding: “I long to be able to go out into the world and experience stuff, see stuff, go to a store, bookstores. But it does not work that way for me any more.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-johnny-depp-s-island-in-the-bahamas>Johnny Depp’s island in the Bahamas</h2><p>His private paradise, Little Hall’s Pond Cay, is the most “pure” place on Earth, according to the star.</p><p>During his trial against Amber Heard, an employee who manages the 45-acre beauty brought it to attention during her testimony. Johnny Depp pays $10,000 a month for someone to look after the sprawling property, situated in the middle of oceanic beauty.</p><p>The island has a main house, two-bedroom yurt, a ’roundhouse’ and a beach house. Not exactly a small wood cabin for being out in the wilderness. Instead it oozes luxury much like other star-studded homes, like <a href=#>Joan Rivers’ New York penthouse</a>.</p><p>It was during his days as Captain Jack Sparrow that he first saw it – fitting for the character he portrayed in Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>After spotting the treasure trove in 2003, he snapped it up for $3.6 million the following year. He couldn’t miss out on that prime <a href=#>real estate</a> with picturesque views.</p><p>It’s also the spot of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp’s Bahamas wedding ceremony.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-special-place-in-his-heart>Special place in his heart</h2><p>He named the beaches after his children, Lily-Rose – who recently made her <a href=#>TV</a> debut next to The Weeknd – and Jack. Another beach is titled after his ex, Vanessa Paradis, while Gonzo beach honors late author Hunter S Thompson. Then there is Brando beach, for his friend and mentor, the Hollywood great Marlon Brando.</p><p>Johnny Depp also splashed out on a yacht, so he could reach his Bahamas paradise at any given moment. It reportedly cost $8 million, much more than the private land itself. It’s believed the eight crew members cost $250-350,000 a month.</p><p>The lavish abode sits around 96km from Nassau, within the Exumas archipelago.</p><p>He also previously divulged he likes to return there after filming is wrapped up to revert to himself. He explained, “escapism is survival to me,” in a Vanity Fair magazine story.</p><p>But, he’s not the only one to drop a lot of cash for private space. Eddie Murphy and David Copperfield also own islands nearby, off the coast of Nassau.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1220623722-1024x714.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-minute-standing-ovation-in-his-comeback>7-minute standing ovation in his comeback</h2><p>Depp may have kept a low profile immediately after the highly-publicized trial against his ex-wife, but it seems he’s making a comeback.</p><p>The star performed alongside friend and late musician Jeff Beck in several shows in Europe. They released a joint album, called 18, which would evidently become Beck’s final release, as he sadly died in January.</p><p>He also showed off his painting skills when he bagged more than $3.6 million through his debut art collection. Weeks after the trial ended, his Friends & Heroes collection sold within a matter of hours. It included 780 prints of four portraits of stars he painted. They were of Al Pacino, Bob Dylan, Keith Richards and Elizabeth Taylor.</p><p>He then made a surprise appearance – albeit virtually – at the <a href=#>MTV Video Music Awards</a> in 2022. His face was featured in the iconic Moonman as it floated above the stage.</p><p>Rihanna received backlash for featured Depp in her Savage X Fenty Vol 4 Show, via Amazon Prime Video. He was the first male on the ‘star moment’ of the sow, which previously went to established models in the industry.</p><p>Although he hasn’t seemed to return to Hollywood, his first movie appearance since the trial was in Jeanne Du Barry. The film, under the watchful eye of French director Maiwenn, saw Depp take on King Louis XV. It opened the 76th Cannes Film Festival, and Depp attended the world premier at the event. Fans applauded the star, before he received a seven-minute standing ovation after the screening. It was reported he teared up over the adoration.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2aCcMDHnqmeq12ku63FjKilnmWgoa6ksYyipWasmJp6uLvRpZtmr5iav6Z5yaifp6apYrGmvM9mnZ6dnKh6tK3FnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
