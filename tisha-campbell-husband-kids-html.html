After 27 years of being together and two amazing children, it pains me to announce that I’ve filed for divorce. It’s an emotional time and I graciously ask for privacy for me, our children and the rest of our family.

However, after 27 years together, the actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed for divorce</a> from her husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After 27 years of being together and two amazing children, it pains me to announce that I’ve filed for divorce.

The reason for their split was cited to be irreconcilable differences.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Initially, both Campbell and Martin requested spousal support, with the actress claiming that her estranged husband earned around $62,000 monthly while she only earned $7,000. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When Martin filed documents of his own asking for spousal support, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Campbell argued</a> Martin should be the one paying her, as he allegedly had 500 shirts, each of which cost $1,500. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Campbell and Martin’s divorce was completed on December 2020. When speaking to People, Campbell expressed though she had just come out of her two-decade marriage, she was the happiest she had ever been.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Campbell and her husband are sharing joint custody of their kids, and neither is paying spousal support. The former couple also agreed to split expenses for their youngest son Ezekiel, including his education and health care costs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Campbell has custody of Ezekiel on Mother’s day, while Martin has him&nbsp;for Father’s day. Aside from those two occasions, the two will alternate custody between odd and even years for other holidays.</p><h2>Tisha Campbell And Her Husband Filed For Bankruptcy</h2><p>Back in 2016, Campbell and her husband&nbsp;filed for bankruptcy. The pair later stated that their split had played a part in the financial miscommunication after the court ordered her and her husband to turn over financial records in their bankruptcy case.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Martin <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> he used to handle their finances by himself before the split. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Prior to our separation, I handled the family finances and business finances by myself. I recognized then that I was not capable of preparing an accounting by myself.</p><p>Martin’s statement came&nbsp;after the trustee of their Chapter 7 bankruptcy accused him and Campbell of improperly diverting all of Campbell’s residuals after the bankruptcy filing, totaling $50,000.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Tisha Campbell’s Kids</h2><p>After their divorce, both Campbell and her husband are equally involved in the raising of their kids. Campbell often takes to Instagram to talk about her sons. This August, the singer wished her older son a happy birthday, writing about how proud she was of him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">also posted</a> a picture and video of her dropping her other son at middle school while expressing how she felt watching her little kid grow up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyZqLWiecKapKmalaG5brTUrJmappRiuKqw0mefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
