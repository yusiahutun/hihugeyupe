Not only do they give you an easy way to change your hair style up, but they can also help protect your natural hair from damage — sometimes. You could potentially end up with traction alopecia, a type of hair loss caused by constant pulling, tugging, and pressure on the hair follicle that can damage your edges. To learn more about wig hair loss, we spoke to Dr. Love, as well as Dr. Crystal Aguh, and Jesseca Dupart.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-traction-alopecia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is Traction Alopecia?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Traction alopecia is a lifestyle disorder," says Dr. Elyse Love. "Black women are not biologically more likely to experience traction alopecia. However, haircare practices in the Black community are more likely to include traction-causing maneuvers. Detangling, heavy braids, long weaves, and styling of leave-out hair are common causes of traction alopecia."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-types-of-wigs-can-cause-traction-alopecia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Types of Wigs Can Cause Traction Alopecia?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Wigs that are super tight can cause traction alopecia," says Dupart. "Also any wigs that require gluing or bonding, which is not healthy for the hair, especially if there is an unskilled person applying. Synthetic bands in wigs can also cause problems, especially for those with sensitive skin." That said, while lace front and clip-in wigs can offer complete coverage of your natural hair, regularly wearing them can cause hair damage, as well as thinning and eventual baldness in certain areas of the scalp.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-areas-of-the-scalp-are-more-prone-to-thinning></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Areas of the Scalp Are More Prone to Thinning?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to both Dr. Aguh and Dr. Love, traction alopecia commonly causes thinning around the hairline due to the delicate nature of the hair in that area of the scalp. "This hair is also more likely to undergo pulling and tugging in an attempt to 'lay' or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>'tame' the edges</a>," says Dr. Love, which is more common practice when wearing a U-wig or half wig. However, it can show up in other places, too. "Hair on the vertex scalp (crown) is also particularly susceptible to traction alopecia," she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-does-it-take-for-traction-alopecia-to-develop></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Does It Take for Traction Alopecia to Develop?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout her career, Dupart has seen her fair share of hair loss stories and says the timeline is different for everyone. "It depends on your go-to style or chemical process, and whether you wear a ponytail, weave, wig, or have a poor diet," she explains. "With hair friction, it usually takes time for the breakage or follicle damage. Those tight hairstyles that give an instant facelift also can slowly recede the hairline." This is why it's important to be mindful of wearing tight wigs too often and opting for more tension-free styles.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-is-it-time-to-see-a-dermatologist-or-a-trichologist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Is It Time to See a Dermatologist or a Trichologist?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moment you notice any hair thinning, give your wigs a break and make an appointment to see either a dermatologist or trichologist. Because while there's a chance your developing alopecia could be caused by your style, there are a number of other ailments that could be contributing to the problem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want to stress that you should avoid trying to self-diagnose, especially if your hair loss is worsening," says Dr. Aguh. "Traction alopecia can look very similar to other forms of hair loss such as alopecia areata, hormonal thinning, and a form of hair loss called frontal fibrosing alopecia. If you have not noticed an improvement in hair loss after avoiding extensions and taking good care of the hair, you should have a formal evaluation by a board-certified dermatologist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Aguh adds that different forms of hair loss require different forms of treatment. In order to find a solution, you must first be properly diagnosed, and the sooner you see a doctor, the better. "The great thing about traction is it is reversible in the early stages," says Dr. Love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The House Passed a Bill That Would Make It Illegal to Discriminate Against Natural Hair</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-treat-traction-alopecia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Treat Traction Alopecia?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Anti-inflammatory injections can be helpful for traction alopecia that is slow to recover," says Dr. Love. "In addition, topical <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>minoxidil</a> can help speed up the recovery process. Platelet-rich plasma also has shown early promising data for stimulating regrowth in traction alopecia." For severe cases, Dr. Aguh says the only option would be to get a hair transplant, which can be quite expensive. "All the more reason to make sure traction alopecia is diagnosed early," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To keep your hair strong and healthy, Dupart recommends using her brand's nourishing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener">Miracle Drops</a> around the hairline two to three times a week, as well as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=sponsored>Therapeutic Shampoo</a> on wash days. "[This] haircare line is created for scalp and hair restoration and overall therapy for your hair," she explains. "It has a cool-minty sensation that purifies the scalp and hair follicles to help grow healthy hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All three experts also agree that regular gentle <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalp massages</a> can help increase blood flow to the scalp. But it's important to note that no matter what treatment route you choose, the hair regrowth process is slow, and it can take several months to see results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-can-i-style-my-hair-to-hide-any-thinning></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Can I Style My Hair to Hide Any Thinning?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to styling, this is a great time to get creative. "The key is to not put tension or adhesives on or around the affected area," says Dupart. Depending on where the thinning is present, you can brush your hair in the opposite direction to provide coverage or opt for a wig that doesn't add any tension to the hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But if you're in a bind, make an appointment with a reputable hairstylist who can help. To prevent thinning altogether, or to avoid making matters worse, Dr. Love emphasizes that you have to be mindful of what you're doing to your hair. "Ultimately, the best treatment is a change in styling practices that minimizes pulling on the scalp," she says. "This will likely include being more mindful about who you pay to style your hair."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-can-i-prevent-traction-alopecia-from-coming-back></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Can I Prevent Traction Alopecia From Coming Back?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Avoid wearing wigs or any protective style that is too tight, advises Dr. Aguh. Dr. Love adds that it's important to revise your entire haircare routine too. "I think we as Black women need to rethink the way we feel about our hair and change the way we treat our hair," she explains. "Our hair does not deserve the punishment we give it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>detangle</a> on wash day, Dr. Love recommends using conditioners with lots of slip to decrease tension on the scalp. Also, make sure to detangle from ends to roots to avoid added pressure on both the hair and scalp. And whether you go with wigs or your protective style of choice, make sure you're not leaving your appointment with a headache or any type of pain on your scalp. "These are all signs of inflammation," says Dr. Love. "The goal should change from making the style last the longest to making a beautiful style that supports the hair and scalp."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-afe73357-ce50-4a0a-813c-2f94e0d57acb></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=49><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can your hair grow back after having traction alopecia?</span></p><p>If you can identify and treat traction alopecia early, then the better chances you have at regrowing your hair.
