Ever since Taylor Swift‘s latest album The Tortured Poets Department reached the ears of millions of fans, they’ve been offering their theories on which songs are about long-time ex Joe Alwyn, The 1975 frontman Matt Healy whom she previously dated for a few months in 2023, or Travis Kelce, her current partner and American football player for the Kansas City Chiefs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Speculation is aflame on social media, but one woman hopes to discover the truth straight from the source…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1732427347.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-donna-kelce-will-ask-taylor-swift-which-songs-are-about-her-son-travis>Donna Kelce will ask Taylor Swift which songs are about her son Travis</h2><p>A significant percentage of the population would be thrilled at the chance to interrogate Taylor over the new album’s lyrics. While that’s impossible for the vast majority, Donna will undoubtedly have the opportunity to ask whatever she pleases.</p><p>“I know there’s a few [songs] that some people think are about Travis, but we’ll just see,” Donna <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Us Weekly during a QVC summit just recently. “You know, I’ll have to ask her when I see her. “</p><p>Weighing in on her thoughts on the record, she commented “it’s her best one,” having listened to it the very “day it was released.”</p><p>She’s right that some widely believe certain tracks to be about Travis. These include track 22, <a href=#>So High School</a>. “You know how to ball, I know Aristotle,” she sings, and plenty of other lyrics have given Swifties suspicions too, as is also the case for track 15, <a href=#>The Alchemy</a>, which contains a bunch of sports references.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>💬 | Donna Kelce on if she has any advice for Taylor about growing older</p><p>“She doesn’t need my advice on anything. In fact, I hope she will give me advice.” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s5T2OzZvTS</a></p>— Taylor Swift News 🤍 (@TSwiftNZ) <a href=#>April 24, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-refuses-to-name-who-her-songs-are-about>Taylor Swift refuses to name who her songs are about</h2><p>While Donna may have a better opportunity to ask Taylor about her songs than the vast majority of others, that doesn’t mean she will be willing to impart her secrets.</p><p>Taylor has acknowledged she doesn’t explicitly address who her lyrics are about when it comes to past loves and relationships.</p><p>“I don’t feel there is any injustice when people expand beyond my music and speculate on who certain songs might be about,” she once explained during an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with GQ.</p><p>“I’ve never named names, so I feel like I still have a sense of power over what people say, even if that isn’t true,” she added, “and even if I don’t have any power over what people say about me. The fact that I’ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I’m holding.”</p><p>As she is her boyfriend’s mom, and they wouldn’t be break-up songs, on the other hand, perhaps the icon will dish out the insider gossip with Donna one evening. If she does, it’s unlikely the fans will find out.</p><p>As with all Taylor albums, however, some of the fun is in letting the imagination soar.
