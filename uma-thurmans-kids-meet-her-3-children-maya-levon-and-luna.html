Thanks to her three wonderful kids, <a href=#><strong>Maya Hawke</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Levon Hawke</strong></a> and <strong>Luna Thurman-Busson</strong>, the Motherhood star has a pretty easy job raising <a href=#>her growing children</a>.</p><p>Uma <a href=#>shares her older kiddos</a>, Maya and Levon, with her ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Ethan Hawke</strong></a>. The <a href=#>Pulp Fiction</a> alum and the Before Sunrise actor wed in 1998 and welcomed their first child, Maya, that same year. The exes’ second kid, Levon, arrived in 2002, but <a href=#>Uma and Ethan split</a> three years later in 2005.</p><p>Following their divorce, Uma entered the dating field and was romantically involved with a few famous men, including <strong>André Balazs</strong> and <strong>David Wike</strong>. In 2007, though, she gave up her status as a single lady when she fell in love with <a href=#><strong>Arpad Busson</strong></a>. The couple expanded Uma’s family when daughter Luna arrived in 2008, and they dated on-and-off for the next six years before splitting in 2014.</p><p>As a mom, Uma shares a great relationship with all three of her kids. Though parenting and balancing her Hollywood career takes “a lot of energy and nerves,” the Kill Bill: Vol. 2 star wouldn’t give up her role as a mom for anything in the world.</p><p>“What does being a mother mean to me? That’s simple … every day, I experience the greatest love I have ever felt,” she gushed in March 2010, according to <a href=#>Indian Express</a>. “I don’t want to miss a second of it.”</p><p>While motherhood can be filled with countless happy moments, Uma knows there is also pressure to raise competent kids. Therefore, she makes sure to always be in a positive and happy headspace when she’s around her family.</p><p>“I don’t want them to notice when I’m exhausted or depressed. They need a steady mother who gives them a feeling of security, otherwise, they might become even more vulnerable than they, as children, already are,” she explained, noting trying to be a good example can be overwhelming at times.</p><p>“I constantly wrack my brains, but unfortunately there’s no manual for it,” Uma continued. “It’s really important to be a role model. But I always try to explain to my children that their mum is only human too.”</p><p><strong>To learn more about Uma’s children, keep scrolling!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46upJplpJ3Cs7nAp6pmo5mZwG65xJ6rZqCVp3p0ecKhoKWcopq7brnAsphmpJWrvK95wKebZqSlo65w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
