I don’t know of anyone who has managed all that yet! But I am truly hopeful for the future. There are lots of brands approaching the sustainability question from different angles; we are all learning, and in a sustainable future, we will combine our learnings and create a sustainable model for our industry. At E.Stott, we are approaching sustainability at every stage – from the design process through to production – with a focus on how the consumer uses our clothes."</p><img alt="a man and woman wearing pink clothes" title=E.STOTT width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/e-stott-ss24-look-1a-1b-657c7c7f1448a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">E.STOTT</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Why is the ‘piece-by-piece’ approach to shopping good for the planet?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Having a sustainable wardrobe is as much about how you wear it, as what you own. Making and selling clothes has a carbon impact. Using less is better for the environment and so one of the key principles behind E.Stott is to make garments that can be worn in different ways and paired with different items. Outfits are created piece-by-piece, through additions of sleeves or belts, and you craft your own collection to adapt to your needs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The versatility of our garments extends their useful life and reduces their environmental impact. And it’s fun to give the wearer more creative freedom! Sometimes it’s hard to tangibly see how your purchasing decisions make a difference. Take ownership of the environmental impact of your wardrobe and adapt something you already own."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">How can we approach partywear dressing in a greener way?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For my sister's traditional countryside wedding, she wore the first edition of the ivory silk satin <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.estott.co.uk/products/esme-addition-ivory?_pos=1&_sid=3e339a0ad&_ss=r" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Esme sleeve scarf" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Esme sleeve scarf</a> (over her dress) for the church ceremony, with an additional exaggerated organza train.

But to create a larger impact on our industry, I would advocate choosing one thing that you believe will make a difference, and relentlessly pursuing that thing and shouting about it. The signalling effect from demonstrating a better way will multiply your impact. For us, it’s about producing garments that can be used and combined in different ways, thereby increasing their use and reducing their environmental impact."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What’s the smallest change a consumer could make to become more eco-conscious?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Reimagining their ownership of a garment. E.Stott promotes that you shouldn’t believe that you have ownership of products – consider it more like guardianship of someone else’s belongings. Look after it. Pass it on when you have finished with it. Buy less, buy better and make it last.</p><img alt="a person in a red dress standing on a tree branch" title=E.STOTT width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/e-stott-ss24-look-34-657c7dff4739e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">E.STOTT</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I like to remind myself of this quote from Orsola De Castro's book, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/317512/loved-clothes-last-by-castro-orsola-de/9780241461150 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Loved Clothes Last" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Loved Clothes Last</a>: 'Clothes touch us all.

Lots of garments use recycled materials, but these often still have a large carbon footprint or are blended and not easy to recycle, so they break the recycling life cycle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"At E.Stott we use a lot of end-of-line fabric. This is fabric that is discarded by larger brands and destined for waste, but is perfectly usable and often extremely high quality. By using this, we drastically reduce our carbon footprint. It does however add constraints to our design process, as we typically have to search out and find the fabric before we design the garments; we don’t have the luxury of choosing fabric from a trade
