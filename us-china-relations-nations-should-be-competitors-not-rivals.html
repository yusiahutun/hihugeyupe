Speaking on Thursday at a virtual forum on China-US relations, Cui Tiankai said the two sides needed to return to dialogue, after their relationship during the Donald Trump administration had been pushed “down the precipice of confrontation”.“We may have competition, but we don’t have to be rivals,” he said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I asked the Trump people when they were still running the State Department, are you going to put all the China provinces on the list, what is your real intention? What can the people in China interpret over this? I think the only conclusion is that the real intention of US policy is to dismantle China as a country – if this is the case, then that is really dangerous.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other attendees at the forum – including former Chinese ambassador to the US Zhou Wenzhong, prominent China scholar David Lampton from Johns Hopkins University, former US ambassador to China Max Baucus and former vice-minister of foreign trade Long Yongtu – stressed the need for more strategic dialogue between the countries at all levels.</p>But while the panellists suggested the two sides cooperate on issues such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">climate change</span></a> and the Covid-19 pandemic, they acknowledged that antagonistic public attitudes and policy narratives on the relationship would be difficult to change.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Washington urges Beijing to stop pressuring Taiwan after airspace incursion reports</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University, said there was a need to distance the relationship from “current, very disturbing domestic political disruption” on both sides, calling for power to be used “sparingly and strategically” for flashpoints such as Taiwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If we just always get our relations highly hijacked by domestic politics in the US, as well as in China, then it’s truly worrisome for how and where our relations will be heading,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lampton said the two sides needed to restore people-to-people exchanges – such as Beijing allowing the US to send its Centres for Disease Control and Prevention personnel back to China – and install management mechanisms for potential flashpoints on China’s periphery. He told the forum that the Chinese side should not assume that the US had so many domestic problems that it would not be more involved if peace broke down on the Taiwan Strait.</p>“This is something that could go out of control very rapidly,” he said. “We need to, as rapidly as we can, and that means in the first year, restore strategically oriented dialogue … We need to also develop crisis management.
