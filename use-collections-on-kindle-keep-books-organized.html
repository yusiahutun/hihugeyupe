So, if you download many books on your Kindle, set up Kindle Collections to find that specific book quickly. Collections also have a use beyond their organizational need. For instance, you can set up Kindle Collections if more than one person uses the same Kindle.

And if you still haven't used a single Collection on your Kindle, learn about them now.</p><h2 id=what-are-collections-in-kindle>What Are Collections in Kindle?</h2><p>Collections are folders you can create on your Kindle to <a href=#>organize similar ebooks together</a>. For instance, you can keep books from the same genre in one Collection. You can easily make another Collection of your "Next Reads" in order of priority. Even a group of documents you read from the web or your PC can help to find them easily. There's no limit to the number of books or documents you can categorize with Collections.</p><p>In some ways, Collections are better organizational tools than folders. You can keep the same book in multiple collections, which is useful when a book straddles two close genres. For instance, action and spy thrillers are sometimes tricky to tell apart.</p><p>Also, Collections can quickly be deleted without erasing the books in them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=how-can-you-access-kindle-collections>How Can You Access Kindle Collections?</h3><p>Once you create a few collections, you can see them on the home screen. A Collection is represented by a gray box with the name of the collection on top and a folder icon. In addition, a number suggests how many eBooks you have in that Collection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kindle-collection.jpg><p>One of the best ways to view Collections on the Kindle is by organizing them by <strong>Grid</strong> and <strong>Collection</strong>. Go to <strong>Sort > Collection</strong> from <strong>Your Library</strong> screen.</p><h2 id=how-to-create-kindle-collections-on-a-kindle>How to Create Kindle Collections on a Kindle?</h2><p>Moving through screens of books on a Kindle is often irksome when you want to open a book and read it instantly. Here's how Kindle Collections can reduce the bother.</p><li>Go to the <strong>Home</strong> screen > <strong>Menu</strong> (the three-dotted kebab icon) > <strong>Create New Collection</strong> > Name your collection.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kindle-collection-name.jpg></li><li>If you are not connected, a screen message will inform you that your collection will not be updated on the cloud until you connect. In short, your Kindle collection is local for the device. Choose to <strong>Ignore</strong> or <strong>Connect</strong> as you desire. Also, any book added directly to the Kindle from a computer will not sync to the cloud, so you will not see the book in the Kindle app or on other devices.</li><li>Populate a collection by long-pressing on a title or the book cover and choosing <strong>Add to Collection</strong>. Select the particular collection and tap on <strong>Done</strong> at the bottom of the screen.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kindle-add-to-collection.jpg></li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Give them creative names and purpose.

But there's something to be said about clearing up the clutter because it makes finding the book or a document much more manageable. So think about this the next time you buy a book on Amazon or download its sample. Wouldn't putting it in the proper collection from the onset be better?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGisrJ1dmLytuMScq6Knnqh6sLqMpKCnnJyaeqyxxKlkm6efoMBuu9GgmKehqpqxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
