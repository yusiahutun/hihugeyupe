1 Stanley: the trendsetterOne of the items most coveted by tweens across America currently, it seems, is the Stanley Quencher tumbler.
Electrolytes and hydration tablets: when and how to use them

It’s really nice,” she says, adding that she is pleased to have snagged one over winter break after seeing it all over <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">TikTok</span></a>, Instagram and the news.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cup’s popularity was probably sparked initially by a woman’s viral TikTok video last November of a Stanley cup that survived a car fire. In response, the Stanley company offered to replace her cup – and her car.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, influencers and popular collaborations have propelled the Stanley cup to new heights. Stanley could not be reached for comment on the trend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/17/3cdea855-db1c-4ef3-b071-4cdf80e2c86e_ae37834e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">University student Hannah Gomez, on the other hand, initially thought people were talking about the US-based National Hockey League’s Stanley Cup competition. She received the popular Stanley tumbler as a gift from her younger sister and did not realise the cachet it would have.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve gotten like five comments on it today,” the 26-year-old says. “People don’t usually stop you for your water bottle.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She likes the handle design and straw, which she says makes her drink more water throughout the day. Plus, it kept her water ice cold from 8am to 5pm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hikers Priscilla Ramirez and Diana Gonzalez say they bought one for its ability to keep water cold – a must at Gonzalez’s warehouse job in the summer – but they were also intrigued after hearing it could float in a pool. They confirmed that it does, indeed, float in a pool.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">2 Hydro Flask: the populist</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2020, the Hydro Flask was the “it” water bottle, the kind that students put at the top of their Christmas lists just like the Stanley cup of today. Teens carried them separately rather than in their backpacks, covering them with stickers and artwork. They were a statement that you were cool and eco-conscious.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the company, the average Hydro Flask purchaser ranges in age from teens to mid-30s and its customers “live full and active lives”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/17/70c9aa1c-6a77-409b-a5f8-85eac872b3e3_23b356c8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leslie Compean, 22, carries a white Hydro Flask she received from her sister for Christmas. She already owned a grey bottle from the same brand but wanted a larger one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I feel like I’m a simple person,” Compean says. Even if unintentional, it seemed to match her white shoes, paired with black pants and a mustard yellow jumper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She does not care about trends, she says, but this bottle “does the job”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/17/bf106381-3fb8-4387-8ade-6accd450cbd1_23b356c8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alfredo Torales, 39, has a black Hydro Flask. It came from the ever-growing lost-and-found pile at the secondary school his wife works at.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These boys always leave Hydro Flasks behind as if they’re worth nothing,” Torales says. “If no one scoops it up after a few weeks, she brings them home.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">3 Owala: the colour-forward accessory</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike other reusable water bottles, Owala screams colour. Each iteration of its flagship FreeSip bottle has at least three different colours for the body, rim and spout. Online, they have names like “Can You See Me?” with bright pinks and reds, and “Gemstone Chic”, with rich jewel tones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Water bottles are a cool tool for self-expression,” says Chad Sorensen, senior brand manager for Owala. “We give you an outlet, a vehicle to do that.”</p>Sorensen adds that the brand has picked up older <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Gen Z</span></a> and millennial women in particular as fans. As the water bottle space has become more about fashion, the company aims to market its products accordingly.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Denai Blackshire, 32, carries a white, black and grey Owala that matches her grey sweats.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you go hiking, you still want to look aesthetically put together,” Blackshire says. An ex-partner bought her the water bottle after she said she wanted to hike more. Her main requirement: it had to be cute.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She also thought the design was clever – a straw for sipping and a larger spout for guzzling. It was named one of Time’s Best Inventions of 2023.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">4 S’well: the stylish classic</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The S’well bottle has a distinctive slim neck design and is small enough to fit in the side pocket of most backpacks. The downsides: it is hard to fit ice cubes in the opening, and the svelte bottles are less visible carried inside a backpack.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alex Holt, 44, carries one with a stainless steel finish. He chose that one because it matches his lunchbox. “It’s like your branding,” his colleagues told him. He says it is also sturdy and keeps his water cold, sparkling or still.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The idea is that we have them for a really long time,” Holt said, rather than changing them with trends.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">5 Nalgene: the sturdy workhorse</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goksu Okar, 32, says she already had a “really big” water bottle that she drinks from all day and wanted a smaller, more portable one. If she wanted to spend more, she would have bought a Yeti (US$28 for a similar style). But the Nalgene is cheap and seemed sturdy – what more could she ask for?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Nalgene bottles cannot keep your water cold, they are relatively inexpensive. The standard 32-ounce wide-mouth bottle is only US$17, while the other brands in this round-up cost US$30 or more. And if you break it, the company will replace it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/17/adb107de-1784-4639-a016-5a68e66109a5_ae37834e.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">The best water bottle? Anything reusable</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My rule of thumb is, don’t spend more than US$20 on a water bottle,” says 18-year-old Sofie Fisher. “Maybe US$25.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Fads have been like a thing forever,” she says. It’s more important to “try to reuse what you have and not consume more”. Fisher uses a Tripalink-branded water bottle she thinks her mum bought on Facebook Marketplace. She does not care for Stanley or any other trendy bottle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s forced consumerism,” she says.</p>But if you are still using single-use <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">plastic bottles</span></a>?
