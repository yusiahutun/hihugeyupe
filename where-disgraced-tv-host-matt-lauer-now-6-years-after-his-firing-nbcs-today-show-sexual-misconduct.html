Per People, Lauer faced even more complaints after the initial accusation, with more victims coming forward and reporting multiple accounts of misconduct.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The formerly beloved TV personality denied many of the accusations, calling them “untrue or mischaracterised”. He admitted to extramarital affairs – as he was married to his then wife, model Annette Roque, at the time – but insisted they were consensual.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Nigel Lythgoe, the SYTYCD producer being sued for sexual assault?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His celebrity friends cut ties with him</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/25/fcdfffa1-85aa-4fdc-8494-534b0a08a7f9_4e5186bc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the revelations, some of Lauer’s friends who had been close to him for years decided to drop him en masse. His former colleague Katie Couric said she cut all ties with him, per The Independent: “I think what I realised is that there was a side of Matt I never really knew.” Back in 2019, fellow TV personality Al Roker told Entertainment Tonight, “I don’t really talk about him that much, but we wish him well.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Lauer reportedly “iced out” many of his old friends too, sources told People in November 2023. The publication reported that his friendship circle has majorly changed compared to when he was in the public eye.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Former Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, however, has continued his friendship with Lauer, reportedly saying at an event last year in New York City that Lauer is a “good man” who is “doing fine”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What about Lauer’s former co-host, Savannah Guthrie?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/25/ec80cb76-6e94-4749-b2ba-c5807b98f21d_4c3bc3f2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the 66-year-old attended an NBC producer’s wedding in New York City with his partner Shamin Abas in December last year, he unexpectedly reunited with a familiar face: his former co-host, Savannah Guthrie.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What has Amber Heard been up to in 2024, since the Johnny Depp trial?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lauer and Guthrie enjoyed a cordial professional relationship throughout their five years as co-hosts, but that all changed after Lauer was fired. While she initially told People magazine that she tried to “keep in touch” with him, she quickly publicly condemned his alleged behaviour. Sources even reportedly claimed that she refused to be in the same room with him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These same sources alleged that Guthrie was hesitant to accept her invitation to the wedding at first. However, she attended in the end and, although it’s unclear whether the two interacted with each other directly, there haven’t been any reports about hostility between them, either.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His new ‘very quiet lifestyle’</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the six years since he was fired, Lauer has notoriously withdrawn from the public eye. The former TV host is rarely snapped out in public – so when he is, the pictures make headlines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In December 2023, he was spotted in The Hamptons doing some shopping while wearing black jeans and an orange puffer jacket.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Will Lauer ever come back to TV?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/25/b6dc3426-aa47-40fc-9f7b-266438f96c3e_2669e16b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some media outlets have also reported that Lauer is considering a comeback – but his friend Gumble doesn’t believe that he would want to return.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think he misses being in the mix sometimes, but I don’t think he misses being on television. He’s got a lot on his plate right now. He’s enjoying his kids, he’s enjoying his life. [When] I talked to him last, he was heading out on his boat,” Gumble told reporters at The Apollo Spring Benefit in New York City last summer.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What happened to Stormy Daniels?

Roque left the US for a while at the time of the allegations, per Hello!, eventually returning to their family home in the Hamptons. However, she and Lauer are said to be focusing on raising their children together, Thijs, Romy and Jack.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their divorce was finalised in 2019, and Lauer began dating his current girlfriend Abas the same year.
