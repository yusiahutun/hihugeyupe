Today is the beginning of our holiday tradition called “The 12 Days Of Christmas”??And so it begins… Today’s card read… ? Take this hint maybe Of all things in the world I’m wanting a baby And hope it’s a girl!!! ??? We have 5 already The merrier, the more And if it turns out a boy I’ll go back to the store! ? #NoPressure …I just want to see little Gias running all over the house!!! ? As a part of this tradition, my husband gives me a gift for each of the 12 days leading up to and including Christmas… It is a tradition that he came up with years ago and that he takes a great amount of pride in. He said to me, “I just want to show you how into you I am and that I know what you like before you like it!” It always amazes me that he is able to find the time to prepare for this occasion, to present it so beautifully and with so much thoughtfulness. Each day is a testament to the love that inspires this tradition… He puts so much effort into making me feel special – His cards, cheesy poems and cute little set-ups really melt me. That special feeling is one of the things that I look forward to most during the holiday season. Now, of course, I enjoy the gifts, but his time and creativity is what I value above all else… If this is something that you think that someone in your life may love and appreciate, you should consider sharing in our tradition. It can be your significant other, your child, a friend or a family in need. The gifts don't have to be elaborate or expensive as long as it comes from the heart. It can be a handwritten letter, a picture or a token from your past. … The only thing that matters is that your gifts are expressions of your unique love for one another… Every couple has their own magic…?❤️ Happy Holidays!!! ✨ #SilverCross Balmoral Pram in Pink #Hermes Avalon Baby Blanket in Rose Airelle/Blanc #Gucci GG Supreme Diaper/Baby Bag #ACaseyChristmas ? #TheCaseyCrew ❄️☃️ #12DaysOfChristmas ??? #Day1 ✔️</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Gia Casey</a> (@gia_casey) on Dec 14, 2018 at 6:22am PST</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDpaCnnV6YvK571qGcq51dnsBus8iaZJyZo5rGbrrOsGSboZ9ixKaww6KloGWVqbWvtcKiq7Jlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
