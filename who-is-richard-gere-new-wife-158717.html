However, age is only a number for the <a href=#>Pretty Woman</a> alum and the publicist, who have since created a beautiful family.</p><p>When they first met in 2014, the Primal Fear star sent his lover flowers until she agreed to go on a date with him. Now, years later, Alejandra says she doesn’t regret getting to know the actor.</p><p>“He is the most humble, sensitive, affectionate, attentive, funny, generous man that I’ve ever met,” she gushed to <a href=#>Hola!</a> in April 2020. “What can I say? I’m so in love! How would you feel if each morning you were asked: ‘What would make you happy today?’ Not a day goes by that he doesn’t mention how important I am to him. I feel very lucky.”</p><p>After marrying in 2018, Alejandra <a href=#>revealed she was pregnant</a> with her and Richard’s first child together in September of that year. At the time, she shared a photo of her husband and the Dalai Lama placing their hands on her baby bump. “A very special moment just a few minutes ago … getting blessings for our precious to come,” Alejandra captioned the pic. “We couldn’t announce it before telling HH Dalai Lama.”</p><p>Once their <a href=#>son Alexander was born</a> in February 2019, Alejandra felt grateful for all of the blessings in her life. “I was a little lost … without light, and knowing him gave meaning to my life,” the brunette beauty said about Richard to Hola! “It was feeling that someone was reaching out and showing me my true path.”</p><p>The couple’s hearts doubled in size when they <a href=#>welcomed their second child</a>, whose name has yet to be revealed, in April 2020. Richard and his love told <a href=#>Hola!</a> she gave birth to a baby boy at their home in New York state.</p><p>Before Richard was married to Alejandra, he was wed to <a href=#><strong>Cindy Crawford</strong></a> from 1991 to 1995, and actress <a href=#><strong>Carey Lowell</strong></a> from 2002 to 2016. During his second marriage, he welcomed his first son, Homer Gere.</p><p>In a 2016 interview with the <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>, Cindy credited her young age for being the reason for their separation. After all, she was 26 years old when she tied the knot with Richard, who was 42.</p><p>“I didn’t think I was young, though, but I was young,” she explained about their wedding day. “I think part of the problem in our relationship was that we were a lot of other things but I don’t know if we were ever friends — like peers, because I was young, and he was Richard Gere.”</p><p>Fortunately, the age difference doesn’t seem to bother Alejandra at all. “Without a doubt, I feel like the luckiest woman in the world,” she gushed to <a href=#>Hello!</a> in April 2018.</p><p><strong>Scroll below to learn more about Alejandra!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6s7XCoZirnF2csrOxjKecsGWnnrOmeZBub3BpZ2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
