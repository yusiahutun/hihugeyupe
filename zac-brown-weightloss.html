If the singer seems a bit classier these days, it's because he's lost weight and has traded his famous beanie for some stylish new hats to start fresh with his latest partnership.
Not only has Brown last 30 pounds, but he's also shed his signature crochet lid. Photos from recent events, including the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Fest, above, show the 'Chicken Fried' hitmaker's suave new look well."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And the horsepower [Republic and Big Machine] have in what they’ve done and to have all this together is a huge deal. It’s a big day to get it together, and an evolution of the band continuing to grow and to better ourselves."</p><p>As it turns out "bettering" himself artistically and career-wise also included a clean, new look.</p><p>Big Machine Label Group's President/Founder&nbsp;Scott Borchetta is a big fan of Brown, admitting he's wanted to work with the talented musician "from day one.
