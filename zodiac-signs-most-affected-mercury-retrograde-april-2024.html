Once it begins, you can expect an increase in awkward encounters, unfortunate forgetfulness, and a general lack of efficiency in every aspect of your life. You may even feel like you’re struggling to move things forward, as Mercury retrograde has a tendency to drag you back into the past and resurrect issues you were hoping would go away. Because Aries is a zodiac sign of passion, drive, combat, intensity, and impulsivity, this retrograde could literally feel like a slap in the face. It could also lead to power struggles with your boss, parent, or anyone you consider an authority figure. It might even bring up ego and identity issues, forcing you to rethink who you are and how you’re asserting your honest opinions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-31.png><p>However, this retrograde is even more painful than it usually is, because it’s taking place in the thick of eclipse season. You just experienced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a lunar eclipse in Libra</a> on March 25, and Mercury retrograde begins right before you’re bombarded by <a href=#>a total </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">solar</a><a href=#> eclipse in Aries</a> on April 8. That makes April the most chaotic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and transformative month of 2024</a>, as you’re being hit by a double whammy of difficult energy. Eclipse season always brings mega changes that speed you up toward your ultimate destiny, but Mercury retrograde is forcing you to tie off loose ends from the past. Not to mention the fact that all of this is happening while Chiron—the wounded healer—is also moving through Aries, bringing our attention to wounds regarding self-expression, determination, and your overall identity. Healing is never pretty and it is certainly not linear, and during this retrograde, you may feel like you’re living in the past and embracing the future at the exact same time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-4-zodiac-signs-will-feel-mercury-retrograde-the-most>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Feel Mercury Retrograde The Most</h2><p>Fortunately, Mercury retrograde ends on April 25 at exactly 8:54 p.m. ET, stationing direct at 15 degrees Aries, leaving parts of your mind, body, and spirit healed.
